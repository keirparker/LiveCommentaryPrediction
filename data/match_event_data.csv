', '   In the final round of Premier League fixtures before the World Cup takes place, rock-bottom Wolves have the toughest task of all, facing Arsenal, who sit atop the pile in first place. The hosts have lost their of their last four, and newly-appointed head coach Julen Lopetegui doesn’t start in his role until November 14th.   ', '   Arsenal, meanwhile, are flying, having won their last two games without conceding a goal while scoring six at the other end. With nearest rivals Manchester City having lost their most recent fixture to Brentford, Mikel Arteta’s Gunners have the chance to move five points clear of the chasing pack with a win in the West Midlands.   ', '   WOLVES (5-3-2): Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Maximilian Kilman, Nathan Collins, Tote Gomes, Hugo Bueno; Boubacar Traore, Ruben Neves, Joao Moutinho; Adama Traore, Goncalo Guedes.   ', '   WOLVES SUBS: Matija Sarkic, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Daniel Podence, Yerson Mosquera, Connor Ronan, Matheus Nunes, Joseph Hodge, Chem Campbell, Dexter Lembikisa.   ', '   ARSENAL (4-3-3): Aaron Ramsdale; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.   ', '   ARSENAL SUBS: Matt Turner, Kieran Tierney, Eddie Nketiah, Rob Holding, Cedric Soares, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson, Mohamed Elneny, Marquinhos.   ', '   Wolves make two changes from their League Cup victory over Leeds in midweek, with Adama Traore back in the side, playing on the right of a front two. It’s five at the back too for the hosts, with Tote Gomes slotting in at the back.   ', '   Arsenal are unchanged from their last league outing, a 1-0 win over Chelsea, with Arteta not tempted to tinker with the XI that many see as his strongest. Gabriel Magalhaes got the winner at Stamford Bridge, and is part of a back four that have conceded just 11 goals so far this season, the joint-lowest in the league.   ', ""   The teams head out onto the Molineux pitch, and we're nearly ready for kick-off here!   "", ""  1'  Jesus kicks off for Arsenal, and we are off and running in the West Midlands!   "", ""  3'  Play halts early on, and Arsenal put the ball out. It's Xhaka who is down, and doesn't look injured, so the midfielder could indeed be feeling unwell at the start of this game.   "", ""  4'  Xhaka is cleared to continue playing and returns to the pitch, meaning the game can get underway again!   "", ""  5'  Arsenal have won six of their eight Premier League away games against Wolves, and have scored at least once in all 16 of their meetings with them in the competition.   "", ""  6'  BALL IN THE NET!!! Martinelli cuts inside and crosses beyond Tote. Jesus is onto it, and smashes a half-volley into the bottom corner, but the flag is up to deny the Brazilian his sixth goal of the season!   "", ""  7'  CHANCE!!! Wolves play through Arsenal's high line and Boubacar Traore has it on the right. He passes centrally to Guedes, but Ramsdale's out to deny him, and Adama Traore's rebound is blocked by Saliba!   "", ""  9'  Wolves lost home and away against Arsenal in the league last season, having lost just two of their previous eight against them.   "", ""  11'  A ball over the top bounces Jesus' way, and he turns Kilman looking to shoot, but a good defensive header from Tote gets the ball back to Sa in the Wolves goal.   "", ""  13'  Semedo wins Wolves' first corner of the game, and after playing a one-two with Moutinho, Guedes crosses, but it takes a deflection off White and goes out for another corner.   "", ""  14'  Saka has it on the byline and whips an early cross towards the front post. It takes a nick off Tote on its way through, leaving Sa scrambling as he tips it behind for a corner!   "", ""  15'  Saka's corner is flicked on by Gabriel in the centre of the box, but his glancing header isn't powerful enough and skews well wide!   "", ""        Fábio Vieira   G. Xhaka               16'  Xhaka does eventually come off having pulled up with illness earlier in the game, and Fabio Vieira is called from the bench to replace him.   "", ""  18'  Arsenal are the only side to have scored in every Premier League game this season, while they've also got the joint-fewest goals conceded and joint-most clean sheets so far, with 11 and six respectively. The Gunners are looking to win three consecutive league games without conceding for the first time since July 2020.   "", ""  19'  Semedo looks to find Adama Traore with a long ball behind the defence, but the Wolves forward doesn't time his run and would've been offside if he'd collected it.   "", ""  20'  OVER!!! After Martinelli slips over, Wolves race down the right on the counter and it's played forward to Guedes. He surges towards the box before pulling the trigger, and sends a decent effort inches over the bar!   "", ""  22'  As well as having the fewest goals (eight) and lowest shot conversion rate (4.8 per cent) in the league this season, Wolves have had fewer different goalscorers than any other side, with just four. Neves has netted half of their eight goals so far this term.   "", ""  23'  WIDE!! White's cross from the right is aimed towards Martinelli, but a good Semedo header takes the ball away from him. Zinchenko crosses the ball back into the box, where Jesus' glancing header flashes just wide!   "", ""  25'  Arsenal have scored in each of their last 29 meetings with Wolves in all competitions since a 1-0 loss back in February 1979. Only against West Bromwich Albion (32) are the Gunners currently on a longer scoring streak in all competitions.   "", ""  27'  Bueno does well to dispossess Odegaard as the Arsenal captain tries to create crossing space, and the young Wolves wing-back also frustrates White after the England defender fails to win a corner.   "", ""  29'  Moutinho looks to move forward on the counter for Wolves, but he's dragged back by Odegaard. The Arsenal midfielder is penalised, but not booked, in a decision which the home fans aren't exactly happy with.   "", ""  31'  Arsenal have had three players sent off in their last two league away games in Wolverhampton, with Martinelli seeing red last season, and both David Luiz and Bernd Leno doing so in the same game February 2021.   "", ""  33'  A long throw-in from Partey is launched into the Wolves box, and Neves has to head it beyond for a corner to prevent the chance progressing any further!   "", ""  35'  Boubacar Traore's superb run sparks a Wolves counter-attack, but the final ball from Moutinho to Guedes is cut out! He would've been through on goal there!   "", ""  36'  OFF THE BAR!!! Arsenal take advantage of Wolves committing men forward and Saka puts Jesus in behind. He narrows the angle before shooting with his right, and smashes the ball beyond Sa, but off the bar and over!   "", ""        Toti   Yellow Card               37'  Neves loses the ball on the edge of Arsenal's box and Jesus bursts forward with it, but he's tripped on halfway by Tote, who is booked by the referee.   "", ""  39'  Wolves have won just one of their last eight Premier League games, drawing one and losing six. They've conceded at least three goals in four of these eight games, as many times as they had in their previous 49 matches in the competition.   "", ""  40'  WIDE!!! White floats a cross to the back post with red and white shirts queuing up, but Jesus mistimes his finish and side-foots a volley wide of the target!   "", ""  41'  Guedes looks to turn Gabriel but goes down on the edge of the box. He's fuming to have not been given one, as Adama Traore collects the ball and blasts well over from the edge of the box!   "", ""  43'  Forward come Arsenal again as White's throw-in is only half-cleared. It's squared to Vieira on the edge of the box, but Wolves have plenty at the back and Collins blocks the effort!   "", ""  44'  BLOCKED!!! Saliba passes back to no-one, and Guedes races onto it, shooting for the far corner from just inside the box, and his effort needs a good block from Gabriel to put it behind for a corner!   "", ""  45'  We'll play two minutes of added time to close out the first half.   "", ""        B. Traoré   Yellow Card               45' + 1'  Jesus advances down the left for Arsenal and cuts inside towards the box, but he's stopped before he can get there as Boubacar Traore drags him down, and the Wolves midfielder is booked.   "", ""  45' + 2'  HALF-TIME: WOLVES 0-0 ARSENAL.   "", ""   A goalless first half comes to an end, and it's not exactly been a match for the ages. The two sides have both played quite reserved football, and the defences are definitely on top at the moment. Arsenal have had the ball in the net, but only from Jesus in an offside position. With that goal not given, chances were few and far between, with neither Sa nor Ramsdale forced into a serious save. The second half should see the game open up a bit more, with the cagey start to the match hopefully giving way to some goals!   "", ""   Jesus' goalscoring drought hasn't been broken in that first half, but the Brazil forward has shown why he's so important all across the pitch for Arsenal. He's held the ball up superbly well for the Gunners, winning six of his nine duels, with half of these coming in the air. He's completed every pass he's made in the final third, and has also won possession back three times, via a tackle, clearance and interception apiece. Active.   "", ""   The teams return for the second half, and here's hoping we see some goals in the next 45 minutes!   "", ""  46'  Neves resumes proceedings for Wolves, and we're back underway at Molineux!   "", ""  47'  Arsenal have won all three of their Premier League games so far this season when going into half time level - they last had a longer such run between August and October 2018, a run of seven.   "", ""  48'  CHANCE!!! Collins heads Odegaard's cross clear and Wolves burst forward on the break. Adama Traore passes wide to Guedes, who is in open space. He crosses to the back post, where Adama Traore has run for the return ball, but Ramsdale gets down to smother the ball before it reaches him!   "", ""  50'  Semedo is clipped late by Partey, but the referee plays advantage with Adama Traore on the ball. He floats one towards Guedes in the box, but Gabriel intercepts for the Gunners!   "", ""  51'  Arsenal have stopped the opposition from scoring a first-half goal in 11 of their 14 games so far this season, with only Newcastle doing so more often (13 times) in the Premier League.   "", ""        T. Partey   Yellow Card               52'  Following that foul on Semedo, the referee comes back to book Partey for his off-the-ball challenge on the Wolves right-back.   "", ""  54'  Wolves failed to score a first-half goal for the 10th time this season. In the 15 games so far, only West Ham and Everton (both 11) have failed to score more often league.   "", ""        Fábio Vieira   Assist               54'  The ball from Jesus was exquisite, and Vieira's timing of run and awareness to find his teammates was just as good!   "", ""        M. Ødegaard   Goal               54'  GOOOAAALLL!!! Arsenal take the lead!! Jesus cut inside from the left before threading a delightful ball through for Vieira, and he squares it across the face of goal where Odegaard and Saka are waiting to tap it home! Odegaard gets the crucial touch, and that well-worked finish puts Arsenal 1-0 up with 10 gone in the second half!   "", ""  57'  Arsenal have now scored nine goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the Premier League this season.   "", ""  59'  Semedo blasts a ball into the box, but the midriff of Martinelli gets in the way, deflecting the ball out over the sideline as the Brazilian wreathes in pain on the floor!   "", ""        Gabriel Magalhães   Yellow Card               60'  Adama Traore gets beyond Saliba and sprints down the left towards the box. Gabriel slides in recklessly, catching the forward right on the edge of the area, and he's booked for the foul that could well have ended up being a penalty rather than free-kick!   "", ""  61'  SAVED!!! From the free-kick, Guedes blasts a low shot to the near post, but Ramsdale sees it all the way and does well to hold the shot!   "", ""  62'  CHANCE!!! Vieira flicks White's cross on to Martinelli, whose ball back across the face is parried away by Sa. Odegaard volleys the rebound goalwards, but Tote gets in the way and Wolves scramble it clear!   "", ""  64'  Victory for Arsenal will mean they are top of the Premier League table at Christmas for the first time since 2007-08. However, the Gunners haven't gone on to win the title in any of the last five times they've topped the table at Christmas (1951-52, 1986-87, 1989-90, 2002-03 and 2007-08), last doing so in 1947-48.   "", ""  65'  CHANCE!!! Jesus is found in space and takes on Collins. He resists shooting though, instead squaring for Odegaard, and Kilman puts it behind for a corner!   "", ""  67'  Collins gets forward to win a header and he links up with Adama Traore. He bursts past two before crossing from the byline, but Ramsdale is out to pluck the teasing ball out of the air.   "", ""        Daniel Podence   João Moutinho               68'  Moutinho comes off in Wolves' first change, and he's replaced by Daniel Podence, making his first appearance for the side since picking up an injury in August.   "", ""        D. Lembikisa   Nélson Semedo               68'  Semedo also comes off having picked up a knock, and Dexter Lembikisa, making his Premier League debut, replaces him.   "", ""  69'  Podence chips over the top for Adama Traore, but Gabriel's cushioned header sends the ball back to Ramsdale. The Wolves forward can't stop in time though, and collides with the Arsenal goalkeeper in the box!   "", ""  70'  Ramsdale is given treatment following that knock from Adama Traore, and he's eventually passed fit and play continues.   "", ""  72'  Arsenal are now the only side in the Premier League this season to have scored in each of their league games, doing so now in all 14.   "", ""  73'  Guedes cuts in-field but is crowded out by Arsenal defenders. However, play is brought back for a free-kick in Guedes' favour, due to a shirt pull on his from White.   "", ""        M. Ødegaard   Goal               75'  GOOOOAAAALLL!!! The Gunners make it two!!! Martinelli beats Lembikisa before finding Zinchenko, whose near-post cross is half-cleared. Martinelli stabs it goalwards, but this too is denied, until the ball drops to Odegaard who lashes it into the bottom corner!! 2-0 to Arsenal, and their captain has really made the difference in this second half!   "", ""  77'  Podence's throughball finds Guedes with space in the box, but the Portuguese winger chooses to shoot from a tight angle, and sprays his shot well wide of goal!   "", ""  78'  Guedes does brilliantly to flick the ball over Saliba's head before racing to the edge of the box. He looks to shoot, but takes too long, allowing Gabriel to step in with a vital intervention and win the ball!   "", ""  79'  Martinelli's far-post cross is headed away by Tote, but White follows in from the edge of the box, dragging his volley wide of the far post!   "", ""        Matheus Nunes   Toti               80'  Wolves look to their attacking options late on, as centre-back Tote is withdrawn for creative midfielder Matheus Nunes.   "", ""  82'  Adama Traore takes on Partey in the box before laying it back to his namesake Boubacar, who hits a first-time shot towards goal and curls it wide of Ramsdale's right-hand post!   "", ""  84'  CHANCE!!! Zinchenko's slip allows Adama Traore space to burst into the box, but the cut-back for his teammates is woeful and finds only open space!   "", ""  85'  Arsenal counter as Jesus holds up the ball before freeing up Saka. He races down the right and finds Jesus with a return ball, but it's put behind for a corner by Collins!   "", ""  86'  WIDE!!! From Arsenal's corner, Wolves launch a counter-attack of their own as Adama Traore surges into open pasture. He hangs a cross from the byline towards Podence, who brings the ball down, flicks it up again, and fires an acrobatic bicycle kick towards goal and wide!   "", ""  87'  Matheus glides through midfield before spotting the diagonal run of Podence into the box, but his throughball is dived upon by Ramsdale for Arsenal!   "", ""  89'  SAVED!!! Adama Traore runs into the area before finding Podence to his right, and his first-time shot is too hot for Ramsdale to handle as he tips it behind for a corner!   "", ""  90'  Adama Traore's cross from a short corner is headed clear, but Neves attempts an audacious shot back in on the volley, which clears the crossbar by some distance!   "", ""  90' + 1'  We're into four minutes of added time as Arsenal look to close out yet another victory in this game.   "", ""        R. Nelson   B. Saka               90' + 1'  Mikel Arteta makes a triple sub in the last few moments, with Saka coming off for Reiss Nelson on the right flank.   "", ""        Mohamed Elneny   Fábio Vieira               90' + 1'  Fabio Vieira, who came on right at the start for the ill Xhaka, is substituted again, and Mohamed Elneny replaces him.   "", ""        Cédric Soares   O. Zinchenko               90' + 1'  Zinchenko also comes off at left-back, and Cedric Soares comes on for the rest of the game.   "", ""        Hugo Bueno   Yellow Card               90' + 2'  Bueno knocks Nelson to the ground as the two contest a bouncing ball from Cedric's clearance, and the Wolves wing-back is booked late on.   "", ""  90' + 4'  FULL-TIME: WOLVES 0-2 ARSENAL.   "", ""   Two second-half goals from captain Martin Odegaard seal the win for Arsenal, which sends them five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table! Odegaard's opening strike, a tap in from inches out, didn't exactly open the floodgates, but Wolves did have chances of their own through Guedes and Podence. Odegaard smashed in a second late in the game though, consigning the hosts to being bottom of the table at Christmas; a table that his Gunners will be sitting on top of over the World Cup break.   "", ""   Odegaard managed three shots on target, scoring Arsenal's match-winning goals with two of them. The Norwegian was busy in the middle of the park, winning possession seven times, one of which came in Wolves' own defensive third. He made a sole tackle, but also conceded two free-kicks, giving a reflection on how scrappy and competitive the midfield battle was at Molineux.   "", ""   A seventh defeat in nine games leaves Wolves in last place going into the World Cup, and new boss Julen Lopetegui has plenty of work to do over the break in order for the side to recover. They're four points clear of safety after 15 games, which despite being bleak, is far from an insurmountable task. Arsenal, meanwhile, are five clear at the summit, and head into the remainder of the season as the team to beat. Could the Gunners' first title win since 2004 really be on the cards?   "", ""   That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game. Until next time, goodbye!   ""]"

United were enjoying a good attack at the other end, but Brentford punished them as soon as they won possession back.

Brentford come again, with Toney trying to set up Hickey this time, but Martinez gets a foot in.

"", ""   Wolves will tackle their first home fixture of the new season, seeking to bounce back from defeat at Leeds United on the Premier League's opening day. Despite taking an early lead at Elland Road, Bruno Lage's side returned to the Midlands empty-handed following a 2-1 loss. During his first campaign at the club, Lage saw his team accrue three fewer points at Molineux than they managed away from home.   "", ""   Seeking to build on a draw with last season's Premier League runners-up Liverpool last weekend, Fulham are on their first road trip since winning promotion in May. Top dogs in the Championship in the 2021-22 campaign, the Cottagers' return to the top flight ended in a 2-2 home draw. Marco Silva's men won 13 away games as they claimed first place in the second tier, but they must step up in class today.   "", '   WOLVES (4-2-3-1): Jose Sa; Jonny Castro Otto, Nathan Collins, Max Kilman, Rayan Ait-Nouri; Leander Dendoncker, Ruben Neves; Daniel Podence, Morgan Gibbs-White, Pedro Neto; Hwang Hee-Chan.   ', '   SUBS: Matija Sarkic, Willy Boly, Tote Gomes, Chem Campbell, Connor Ronan, Nelson Semedo, Luke Cundle, Goncalo Guedes, Adama Traore.   ', '   FULHAM (4-2-3-1): Marek Rodak; Kenny Tete, Tosin Adarabioyo, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson; Harrison Reed, Joao Palhinha; Neeskens Kebano, Andreas Pereira, Bobby De Cordova-Reid; Aleksandar Mitrovic.   ', '   SUBS: Bernd Leno, Kevin Mbabu, Issa Diop, Shane Duffy, Rodrigo Muniz, Tom Cairney, Tyrese Francois, Jay Stansfield, Nathaniel Chalobah.   ', '   Following the exit of Conor Coady and arrival of Portuguese winger Guedes from Valencia this week, Wolves still select the same starting lineup that lost to Leeds United on the opening day. While Hwang continues to lead the line up front - supported by Podence and Neto - Guedes starts on the bench.   ', ""   Fulham also keep faith in the XI who started last week, in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool. Last term's top scorer Mitrovic leads the attack once more, while Diop - signed from West Ham this week - is among the visitors' substitutes. In midfield, recent arrival Palhinha comes up against several of his countrymen from Portugal.   "", '   The players are out on the pitch at a sunny Molineux, with kick-off now just moments away!   ', ""  1'  Fulham kick off, and we are under way in Wolverhampton!   "", ""  3'  SAVE! The first chance falls to Neto, who slips through the Fulham defence on the left side of the area before firing a near-post shot at Rodak. The ball then rebounds threateningly across the goal-line, but the flag is then raised for offside.   "", ""  5'  GOOD STOP! Rodak is called upon once again, as Hwang makes the same sprint through the Fulham back four as Neto - shooting towards the near post from 10 yards out. The goalkeeper makes a routine stop, but was well positioned to do so. Wolves are looking dangerous!   "", ""  7'  Before today's game, Wolves had won nine of their last 12 league games against Fulham - edging the last three in a row by the same 1-0 scoreline.   "", ""  9'  Gibbs-White, who has been serenaded by the crowd throughout the game so far, is brought down by Palhinha's trip in midfield, but Wolves fail to make anything of the subsequent free-kick.   "", ""  11'  After Neto fires a low cross along the six-yard box from the left, the ball bounces out to Hwang 20 yards out, but the Wolves striker snatches at his shot, which sails high and wide of the target.   "", ""  13'  Wolves are certainly on top in the opening stages of their first home match, and they will want to capitalise soon, given Fulham's ability to strike on the break.   "", ""  15'  With an opportunistic volley from just outside the box, Mitrovic sends the ball careering well over the crossbar and into the jeering fans behind the Wolves goal.   "", ""        Daniel Podence   Yellow Card               17'  After taking a heavy touch and then hauling back Reed in an attempt to retrieve the ball, Podence is shown the game's first yellow card.   "", ""  19'  Pereira picks up a good position on the left side of the area, but his attempted cutback to Mitrovic is heavily overhit and zips out of play on the far side of the pitch.   "", ""  21'  OFF THE LINE! After Kilman is forced to head the ball behind inside his own area, Fulham's first corner - delivered by Pereira - picks out Decordova-Reid in the centre of the box. His goal-bound header is hacked away off the line by Neves, and the rebound is then scrambled clear.   "", ""  23'  Having narrowly escaped at the other end, Wolves earn another corner, but Gibbs-White's cross is cleared away from danger by the Fulham defence at the second attempt.   "", ""  24'  Due to the heat in England today, a cooling break is under way, with both coaches taking the opportunity to speak to their players while the teams take on water.   "", ""  26'  The game resumes following the drinks break, and Fulham make a rare foray into the Wolves half, which the hosts then repel.   "", ""  28'  The home side's dominance extends to having 61 per cent of the ball so far, but Wolves have only managed two shots at goal compared to Fulham's three.   "", ""  31'  CLOSE! A terrible mix-up between Rodak and Tosin almost results in a Wolves goal, as they collide on the right side of the area; allowing Neto to steal the ball. His cross-shot falls to Podence, who fails to capitalise and drags his attempt wide.   "", ""  33'  Never troubling Sa, a low strike from Robinson, who had drifted into a central spot - around 20 yards out - flies past the right-hand post.   "", ""  35'  Wolves captain Neves makes a hash of striking a long-range free-kick at goal, and the ball sails well wide of the right-hand post.   "", ""        Rúben Neves   Yellow Card               36'  For a crunching late tackle on his compatriot Palhinha, Neves is the second Wolves player booked today.   "", ""  37'  Tempers seem to be fraying in the heat at Molineux, as Palhinha is pulled up for an aggressive aerial challenge on Gibbs-White. Of course, he doesn't agree, but Wolves will have a free-kick.   "", ""  39'  Confined to a tight spot by the corner flag, Ait-Nouri does well to buy a goal-kick by playing the ball off a Fulham player. Such craft pleases the home fans too.   "", ""  41'  Kebano complains after going down as Fulham attempt to counter, following a Wolves corner-kick. The referee is not interested, though, and the game goes on - we are ambling towards half-time here.   "", ""  43'  Neto receives the ball from Podence's clipped crossfield pass, but the chance of bursting into the area from the left is ended when he is brought down by Palhinha.   "", ""        João Palhinha   Yellow Card               44'  A foul on Neto deep inside his own half sees Palhinha pick up a yellow card - Fulham's first of the game.   "", ""  45'  The ball falls into the path of Neves from a corner, but unable to get his body into the right shape to strike it cleanly, the Wolves skipper sends his shot well wide of the left-hand post.   "", ""  45' + 2'  The officials have indicated there will be at least two minutes of stoppage time at the end of the first half.   "", ""  45' + 3'  HALF-TIME: WOLVES 0-0 FULHAM   "", ""   Having bossed the ball and carved out more openings than their visitors, Wolves will be disappointed that their lack of cutting edge has cost them a deserved lead at the break. Neto has persistently threatened to unpick Fulham when drifting in from the left, but the hosts are yet to find the finishing touch. Following last week's heroics, Silva's side have put in a low-key performance so far and must hope to improve after the interval.   "", '   Wolves are without a win from their last 11 Premier League games in August (since a home win against Fulham in 2011), while Fulham are winless in their last 10 top-flight visits to Molineux, since 1962. Surely something has to give in the second half?   ', ""  46'  We are back under way in Wolverhampton!   "", ""  47'  Neves escapes censure for a couple of crunching challenges in midfield, and the home crowd have responded warmly to their captain's endeavour. Clearly, he wants to lead Wolves from the front.   "", ""  49'  After a Fulham move into the final third breaks down, Wolves quickly counter, but the hosts' back four holds firm.   "", ""        H. Reed   Yellow Card               50'  Reed makes a tackle from behind on Hwang in midfield, and the referee deems the challenge worthy of a yellow card.   "", ""  52'  A direct run down the left by Kebano is halted by Jonny's intervention; conceding a corner. Pereira's cross from the set-piece totally evades Sa's attempted punch, and the ball has to be scrambled clear from inside the goalkeeper's six-yard box.   "", ""  54'  CLOSE! After receiving the ball in space on the left, Ait-Nouri surges down the flank and delivers a delicious low ball to the back post, which Gibbs-White can only turn over from close range, at full stretch. That's the best chance there's been in the second half.   "", ""  56'  Though yet to break through and open the scoring, Wolves have continued to have the greater share of possession since the break, with 58 per cent of the ball so far.   "", ""        Gonçalo Guedes   Hwang Hee-Chan               58'  A hearty cheer greets Guedes onto the pitch for his Wolves debut, as Hwang makes way following a frustrating shift up front.   "", ""  60'  With his first contribution since coming on, Guedes threatens to burst past Tosin on the left flank, but then overhits an early cross towards the box with the outside of his boot.   "", ""  62'  Kebano has grown in confidence in the second half, but after he jinks through into a good crossing position on the left, his cutback lacks accuracy and Wolves are able to clear their lines.

', ""   City's quest to make it three Premier League titles in a row got off to a good start last week as they cruised to a 2-0 win away to West Ham United. Now the defending champions welcome newly promoted Bournemouth to Manchester for their first home game of the campaign, having lost just one such game in the last 22 seasons.   "", ""   Bournemouth are already off the mark this season after picking up a 2-0 win of their own away to Aston Villa last week. While Scott Parker's Cherries face a far sterner test here, only two teams have won away from home against the reigning champions in the last 20 Premier League seasons. One was Parker's Fulham in 2020-21.   "", '   MANCHESTER CITY (4-3-3): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Joao Cancelo; Kevin de Bruyne, Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan (c); Riyad Mahrez, Erling Haaland, Phil Foden.

', '   AFC BOURNEMOUTH (3-4-3): Mark Travers; Jefferson Lerma, Chris Mepham, Lloyd Kelly (c); Adam Smith, Ben Pearson, Lewis Cook, Jack Stacey; Marcus Tavernier, Kieffer Moore, Ryan Christie.   ', '   SUBS: Siriki Dembele, Neto, Junior Stanislas, Jamal Lowe, Emiliano Marcondes, Philip Billing, Jaidon Anthony, Marcos Senesi, James Hill.   ', ""   There's just one change to Pep Guardiola's City from their victory over West Ham. Mahrez takes Grealish's place in the front three.   "", ""   Three new players come into Bournemouth's starting 11 from their game against Villa. Stacey, Christie and Cook get the nod from Parker.   "", ""   On paper, this should be a comfortable City victory. The Citizens have won all 10 of their Premier League matches against Bournemouth, the best 100%-winning ratio by a team against another in Premier League history. In fact, the Cherries haven't won any of these sides' 16 league meetings historically. Anything other than a City win here would be a big shock.   "", ""  1'  The visitors Bournemouth get this game underway!   "", ""  2'  City start brightly, winning an early corner down their left. From the delivery, the former Bournemouth centre-back Ake heads wide.   "", ""  4'  City are already dominating possession. The hosts force another corner down their right. This one's nodded off-target by Rodri.   "", ""  5'  Mahrez runs onto a sliderule pass down the right and skips past Stacey, who scythes the Algerian down. That'll be a City free-kick.   "", ""        J. Stacey   Yellow Card               5'  Stacey's booked for his early indiscretion. The Bournemouth left wing-back will have to watch himself now.   "", ""  7'  Bournemouth manage to deal with the free-kick, but City aren't letting up. The champions win another corner as Ake's shot from the left of the box is blocked. De Bruyne swings it in and Mahrez's effort is too high.   "", ""  9'  Chance for City! De Bruyne's shot from distance is blocked but the Belgian persists, sliding Foden into the box. Foden has two men to his right but ignores them, going for goal himself. Travers saves, and Haaland thumps the turf in frustration. City get a corner. They've been relentless since kick-off.   "", ""  10'  Dias' header from the centre of the box from the corner is blocked. Bournemouth have barely been able to get out of their half so far.   "", ""  12'  Gundogan wins a free-kick for City down their right as Christie impedes him. The resulting attack doesn't work out as the offside flag goes up.   "", ""  14'  Bournemouth spot a brief opportunity to pass upfield, but Ake gets across to cut the throughball out.   "", ""  16'  City are staying patient, passing the ball this way and that. Rodri attempts to pick out Mahrez with a crossfield pass that floats harmlessly out of play.   "", ""        İ. Gündoğan   Goal               19'  GOAL! MANCHESTER CITY 1-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH! It's been coming. Gundogan pulls off a cute backheel flick with his back to goal to lay the ball off to Haaland. The big Norwegian returns the favour to find Gundogan's dart into the box, and the German slots easily past Travers.   "", ""        E. Haaland   Assist               20'  Haaland knew what Gundogan was up to and found him easily for the goal. Apparently Haaland's passing isn't great, but this goal proves that's nonsense.   "", ""  20'  That's Gundogan's first goal of this nascent Premier League season. City have now scored in all of their last 11 Premier League games.   "", ""  21'  City almost double their lead as Travers just beats Haaland to a ball over the top. Up the other end of the pitch, Bournemouth get their first shot of the game as Pearson's hopeful shot is saved by Ederson.   "", ""  23'  City force Stacey to concede another corner. Bournemouth get some respite as Dias is too rough with Christie and fouls him.   "", ""  25'  There's a brief break in play to allow the players to get water. It's a scorching day here in Manchester.   "", ""  27'  Play resumes. Rodri curls not too wide from the edge of the box from Mahrez's cutback.   "", ""  29'  Bournemouth make a rare foray upfield. Ake blocks a cross from the right to hand the visitors a corner.   "", ""  30'  City handle Bournemouth's corner easily. The Cherries keep the ball in their own half before finding Smith down the right. Moore swipes at Smith's cross but can't make a firm connection with it.   "", ""        K. De Bruyne   Goal               31'  GOAL! MANCHESTER CITY 2-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH! Bournemouth get caught upfield and Foden finds De Bruyne. The Belgian drives inside from the right, performs a few stepovers, and pokes into the bottom left corner with the outside of his right foot. That's a delightful finish.   "", ""        P. Foden   Assist               32'  This shows just how dangerous City are. You can either camp in your own half and get passed to death, or venture forward and get cut open as Foden did there to find De Bruyne. They're just too good for Bournemouth.   "", ""  33'  De Bruyne's contributed to goals in his last three Premier League games now. The Belgian has been in a great vein of form since the end of last season.   "", ""  35'  Haaland's a bit too eager to beat Lerma and fouls the defender in the process.   "", ""        P. Foden   Goal               37'  GOAL! MANCHESTER CITY 3-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH! De Bruyne skips inside on his right foot and rolls in Foden, whose shot has too much power for Travers to keep out. This game's already over as a contest.   "", ""        K. De Bruyne   Assist               37'  What can Bournemouth do? This goal came just after they caused City a few problems and Smith had a shot blocked in the centre of City's box. City strode upfield and De Bruyne did the rest.   "", ""  39'  That's four assists for De Bruyne in nine Premier League appearances against Bournemouth. He loves playing against the Cherries.   "", ""  41'  Christie catches Gundogan with a high foot, leaving the German worse for wear. Play's stopped while the City man receives treatment.   "", ""  43'  Tavernier wins a free-kick in his own half as he's caught by Cancelo.   "", ""  45'  Haaland goes for goal on the volley from the left of the box. The shot's tipped out for a corner by Travers. There'll be at least four minutes added on before half-time.   "", ""  45' + 2'  City are showing no signs of letting up before the break. Foden whips in a left-footed cross that Haaland dives to reach but can't make contact with.   "", ""  45' + 3'  De Bruyne and Mahrez play a one-two to allow Mahrez to get near Bournemouth's corner flag. The Algerian can't prevent Bournemouth from getting a throw-in though.   "", ""  45' + 4'  HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 3-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH   "", ""   City made light work of Bournemouth in that first half. Goals by Gundogan, De Bruyne, and Foden have put the defending champions in a commanding position. The Cherries have tried their best to cope with Guardiola's men, but City have barely put a foot wrong since kick-off.   "", ""   City are unbeaten in their last 24 Premier League matches when leading at half-time, dating back to May last year against Brighton and Hove Albion. It's hard to see them not adding to their already comfortable lead in the second half. Interestingly, Haaland had just five touches of the ball in the opening 45 minutes.   "", ""        J. Grealish   P. Foden               46'  City make a half-time substitution. Grealish replaces Foden.   "", ""  46'  City get the second half started. Let's see if they're as dominant as they were in the first.   "", ""  48'  City are getting back to where they left off, popping the ball around without a care in the world. All Bournemouth can do is shuttle from side to side and try to keep their shape.   "", ""  50'  De Bruyne's first-time cross from a centre-right position bounces out of play.   "", ""  52'  Grealish's cutback from the byline is cut out. The assistant's flag goes up anyway.   "", ""  54'  Ederson claims a routine cross into City's box from Smith. The tempo of the game has definitely slowed, unsurprisingly given the scoreline and the heat.   "", ""  55'  Chance for City! De Bruyne races onto Gundogan's around-the-corner pass to shoot straight at Travers at his near post. The Bournemouth goalkeeper does his job and keeps the shot out.   "", ""  56'  City keep the pressure on following a few corners and Mahrez spanks a volley into a defender's midriff. Grealish is tugged down by Mepham.   "", ""        C. Mepham   Yellow Card               57'  Mepham's booked for halting Grealish's dribble. City now have a free-kick in a central position, too far out to shoot from.   "", ""  58'  De Bruyne lets fly from the edge of the box. The shot's always rising and is at no risk of testing Travers.   "", ""  60'  Mahrez jinks inside from the right of the box and finds Gundogan just outside the D. Gundogan's curling shot is off-target.   "", ""  62'  City are getting close to breaking Bournemouth down again. Seconds after Travers tips Mahrez's long-range effort wide, Haaland can't reach Walker's cross. Cancelo picks up the pieces, carries the ball inside, and has a shot closed down.   "", ""        J. Stanislas   R. Christie               63'  Bournemouth make their first substitutions of the game. Stanislas comes on for Christie first.   "", ""        P. Billing   L. Cook               63'  Cook heads off too. Billing takes his place on the pitch for Bournemouth.   "", ""        J. Stones   Rúben Dias               64'  City make a few more changes too with the game already won. Stones replaces Dias at centre-back.   "", ""        Bernardo Silva   İ. Gündoğan               65'  Gundogan heads off next. Silva takes his place at the heart of City's midfield.   "", ""  67'  Play pauses for another water break after Bournemouth defend a City corner. The fans in the Etihad Stadium are having great fun.   "", ""  69'  City pull off a few more passing triangles. Grealish can't master Silva's dipping cross from deep to the right of goal, jarring his foot in the process. The City midfielder stays down and gets checked over by the physios.   "", ""  71'  Grealish is thankfully back on his feet and back on the pitch.   "", ""  73'  Haaland surprisingly scuffs wide from the centre of the box from Grealish's pass. That'll be the City forward's last act of the game.   "", ""        J. Álvarez   E. Haaland               74'  Haaland walks off to applause from the City fans. Alvarez takes his place up front.   "", ""  76'  Smith pushes the tricky Grealish over to give a free-kick away.   "", ""  78'  Bournemouth haven't attempted a shot in this second half yet. City have got things well under control.   "", ""        J. Lerma   Own Goal               79'  GOAL! MANCHESTER CITY 4-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH! Cancelo twists this way and that down the left and drills a cross into the six-yard box. It ricochets off the unfortunate Lerma into his own net.   "", ""        M. Senesi   M. Tavernier               80'  Bournemouth substitution. Their Argentine defender Senesi replaces Tavernier.   "", ""        R. Lewis   K. Walker               82'  City substitution. The 17-year-old Lewis replaces Walker.   "", ""  84'  Stanislas fires not far wide from outside the box. City earn a corner down their right. Senesi heads it away from goal. This game is clearly winding down.   "", ""  86'  Mahrez's left-footed delivery into the box doesn't find a teammate.   "", ""  88'  Ake and Moore stay down after a bruising but fair tussle for the ball.   "", ""        J. Lowe   K. Moore               90'  Bournemouth take Moore off with their last change. Lowe goes up front for added time. There'll be at least three minutes of it.   "", ""        A. Smith   Yellow Card               90' + 1'  Smith blatantly shoves Cancelo in the face to stop the City full-back from getting past him. It's an obvious yellow card offence.   "", ""  90' + 3'  FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 4-0 AFC BOURNEMOUTH   "", ""   City have cruised to an easy victory against new boys Bournemouth. The Citizens got the job done with three first-half goals. Lerma's unfortunate own goal added gloss to their victory in the second half. Bournemouth were no match for the defending champions. There's no shame in that.   "", ""   City's four-goal haul takes them top of the early Premier League table for now, ahead of Arsenal on goal difference. They've yet to concede a goal and will take some stopping again this season. Bournemouth drop to ninth, having attempted just three shots here. Their season won't be judged on games like this.   "", ""   It's two wins in two for City, then, who've made a strong start to their Premier League defence. They'll have tougher tests to come. That's all for now. Goodbye!   ""]"

There's no Neal Maupay in the squad amid talks about his future.   "", ""   There's just one change from Howe to the side that beat Nottingham Forest last time out, and it's an enforced one. Matt Targett is missing from the squad, so Botman comes in to make his debut. He slots in at centre-back, which means a move out to left-back for Burn, who is back at his former club.

Burn tries to slide it through to Wilson, but it bounces over his head and out near the byline.   "", ""  4'  It was a good switch from Gross out to Trossard on the left and he shuffles past Trippier before deciding to go for goal himself from range. It takes a big deflection off Almiron on the way through which helps it wide.

Gross whips this one in and it's well dealt with between Burn and Saint-Maximin.   "", ""  8'  Newcastle are struggling to get out of their own half at the moment as Brighton push forward again. Trossard gets the better of Trippier to curl in a cross, but Schar is in the way of it.   "", ""  10'  It's a great tackle from Veltman to dispossess Wilson on the edge of the box and he sets Brighton on the counter. March tries to slide it through to Lallana but overhits it straight out of play.   "", ""  12'  Following a 2-1 victory in March, Newcastle are looking to secure consecutive league wins over Brighton for the first time since beating them twice in the 2016-17 Championship campaign.   "", ""  14'  NO GOAL! Trippier's free-kick is only half-cleared by Brighton, and it's worked back into Wilson. On the turn, he gets his foot up to control the ball before firing it across goal, but the whistle had already gone after he nearly caught Dunk with the high boot.   "", ""  16'  Newcastle are moving the ball quicker when they win it back now and Willock tries to switch it out to Joelinton in space on the opposite flank. He scuffs as it though and it's an easy clearance for Veltman.   "", ""  18'  Sanchez goes long for March and Burn is caught out as it sails over his head. March has acres of space to run into, but the defender is let off by the offside flag.   "", ""  20'  GOOD SAVE! Trossard skips past Trippier and darts down the left before pulling it back from the byline. It hits Pope and bounces up kindly for Welbeck, but the keeper reacts well to push it off his head.   "", ""        A. Saint-Maximin   Yellow Card               22'  Saint-Maximin was ready to skip into the box when Mac Allister stuck out a leg, but the midfielder pulled out of the challenge. The Frenchman throws himself to ground and he's booked for diving.   "", ""  24'  Trippier is down for Newcastle and receiving treatment, which is the cue for the players to take their cooling break. The right-back is okay to carry on.   "", ""  26'  CHANCE! A poor clearance by Dunk is latched onto by Joelinton and he quickly sets Saint-Maximin away. He squares it across the edge of the box to Almiron, but he fires his first-time shot high into the stands.

His arm was tight to his side and it hit him from close range, so the referee waves the claims away.

Schar stoops to clear it, and takes a kick to the head for his trouble, with Newcastle getting the free-kick.   "", ""  33'  OFF THE LINE! Gross drills a low cross into the middle and Welbeck misses it, but the clearance goes straight to March. His low shot pinballs through the box and past Pope, but Trippier has two attempts to clear it away.   "", ""        A.

He squares it to Lallana on the edge of the box, but his shot is blocked.   "", ""  38'  Brighton are keeping the pressure on here and the space opens up for Caicedo outside the box. He curls a powerful effort on goal, but it's straight down the middle at Pope.   "", ""  40'  Joelinton pushes his way through midfield before Wilson takes over and spreads it out to Willock. He tries to drill a low shot across goal, but a deflection helps it loop in Sanchez's gloves.   "", ""  42'  SAVE! Gross catches out Newcastle's defence by pulling it back to Lallana on the penalty spot instead of whipping in a cross. He spins and hits the shot on the half-volley, but it's straight at Pope.   "", ""  44'  Trippier slides it through to Saint-Maximin and he leaves Webster on the floor as he cuts inside. It's a poor pullback towards Wilson though and Dunk clears his lines.   "", ""  45' + 1'  GOOD SAVE! Almiron beats Webster to the ball and slides it through to Wilson. He turns, but can't sort his feet out quickly enough and Sanchez makes himself big to smother it.   "", ""  45' + 3'  HALF-TIME: BRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBION 0-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED.   "", ""   It's goalless at the break between Brighton and Newcastle. The hosts had the better of the first-half chances and had most of the ball across the line before Trippier made a last-ditch clearance to keep the score level and deny March. Caicedo and Lallana both had chances saved by Pope. Wilson did have the ball in the back of the net, but it was disallowed for a high boot by the forward.   "", ""   Potter's side were bright in the first half, getting into some dangerous positions, but their end product was lacking at times, so he'll be hoping that can improve after the break. Newcastle have seen slightly more of the ball, but their best chances came on the counter.   "", ""  46'  Brighton get us back underway for the second half!   "", ""  48'  The hosts have made a bright start to the game with Trossard darting down the left before squaring it to Lallana on the edge of the box. He tries to return the favour, but the Belgian isn't on the same wavelength and the chance is gone.   "", ""  50'  GREAT SAVE! It's a brilliant cross in from March on the right and Lallana peels off the back of Dunk to get his head to it. He thumps it on goal and Pope stretches to push it wide from close range.   "", ""  52'  Newcastle just can't get out as Brighton continue their bright start to the second half. Joelinton loses out to Caicedo, who quickly touches it through to Welbeck, but his first touch gets away from him.   "", ""  54'  Brighton neatly work it from left to right and back again, but Newcastle have dropped deep into their shape to block off the space ahead of them.   "", ""  56'  Veltman goes long down the right again and March is chasing down the throughball. Pope comes a long way out of his box and gets there ahead of the winger to clear his lines in time.   "", ""  57'  Tempers have well and truly boiled over after a coming together between Joelinton and March. The Brazilian really isn't happy, and he starts the pushing, which prompts everyone else to get involved before the referee can calm things down.   "", ""        Joelinton   Yellow Card               58'  The referee pulls both players aside and gives them a warning for the argument. Joelinton goes into the book.   "", ""        S. March   Yellow Card               58'  And so does March for his involvement.   "", ""  60'  Newcastle are just trying to get a foothold in this game after being on the backfoot for most of the second half so far. Guimaraes manages to spin out of trouble in the middle, but can't pick out Wilson with a throughball.   "", ""  62'  Trippier's corner is just too high for Joelinton, but the clearance goes straight back to the right-back. He swings another good cross into the box, but Burn had just drifted into an offside position.   "", ""  64'  Webster misjudges the long ball by Willock and it bounces kindly for Wilson. He helps it onto Saint-Maximin down the right before making a move into the box and Veltman just beats the forward to the cross.   "", ""        E. Mwepu   A. Lallana               65'  Brighton are making the first change of the game, and it's Lallana that's making way for Mwepu.   "", ""  67'  Webster's throw-in is flicked past Trippier by Mwepu and he pulls it back to Trossard at the near post. He, unselfishly, squares it to Welbeck on the edge of the six-yard box, but Botman slides in with a brilliant tackle to deny him.   "", ""  69'  Newcastle are getting ready to make a change, but before that happens, the players make their way to the sidelines for the second-half cooling break.   "", ""  71'  Newcastle are enjoying a good spell of possession here, but it's all in front of Brighton. The hosts are pressing high upfield though and making it difficult for them to get through.   "", ""  73'  GREAT SAVE! As the corner was taken, two players toppled into the net before the ball even reached the box. Mwepu brings it down, pulling it back for March, and his low, first-time shot is kept out well by Pope.   "", ""        K. Mitoma   S. March               74'  Brighton are making a double change here, and March, who has come closest to scoring today, goes off for Mitoma to make his debut.   "", ""        T. Lamptey   L. Trossard               75'  And Trossard also makes way, with Lamptey on in his place.   "", ""        J. Murphy   A. Saint-Maximin               75'  Newcastle are finally able to make their changes as well. Saint-Maximin is the first to go off, with Murphy replacing him.   "", ""        S. Longstaff   J. Willock               76'  And Longstaff also comes on in place of Willock.   "", ""  78'  Sanchez goes long again and Welbeck spins away from Botman. He's through on goal, but the bounce gets away from him which allows Burn to clear his lines.   "", ""  80'  Newcastle break on the counter again and it's fizzed through to Almiron down the right. He drills a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box, but there's no one there to meet it for the visitors.   "", ""  82'  OFF THE LINE AGAIN! It's well worked by Brighton again with Gross pulling it back to Veltman on the edge of the box. It takes a big deflection off Burn which catches out Pope, but Schar keeps his cool behind him to stop it from crossing the line.   "", ""  84'  SO CLOSE! Newcastle just can't cope with Brighton's attacks at the moment and Mitoma skips past Trippier before pulling another good ball back into the middle for Gross. His contact isn't clean, and he sends it inches wide of the near post off his heel.   "", ""  86'  Wilson's frustration is starting to show as he's struggled to get into the game in the second half. Another long ball is played towards him, but he gets in a tangle with Dunk and the foul goes against him.   "", ""        C. Wood   C. Wilson               87'  Wilson tries to take the long way off the pitch, but the referee shepherds him off on the far side to stop the time-wasting. Wood replaces him.   "", ""  89'  Newcastle are pushing higher upfield as the end of the game ticks closer, and they turn over possession and mount a counter. Almiron slides it forward for Longstaff down the right, but his cross hits Webster.   "", ""  90' + 1'  Into the first of four added minutes here and Newcastle have a corner. Trippier swings it in, but it's over everyone's heads before Dunk flicks it away at the far post.   "", ""        F.

He had a chance cleared off the line in both halves, with Trippier and Schar keeping their side in it. Pope also made a brilliant close-range stop to keep out Lallana just after the break. Newcastle didn't threaten too often, though Wilson did have the ball in the back of the net at one point, but it was chalked off for a high boot by him.

', '   Both teams suffered a defeat on the opening day of the season, with Villa losing 2-0 away to newly promoted Bournemouth. Meanwhile Everton we’re narrowly beaten 1-0 by Chelsea, after conceding a penalty.   ', '   It was up front that both sides looked a bit short last weekend, with Coutinho unable to influence the game for Villa. Everton only have Salomon Rondon as a recognised striker, with Richarlison sold to Tottenham and Dominic Calvert-Lewin out injured.   ', '   ASTON VILLA (4-3-3): Emiliano Martinez; Matty Cash, Diego Carlos, Tyrone Mings, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, John McGinn, Jacob Ramsey, Phillipe Coutinho, Ollie Watkins, Danny Ings.

', '   EVERTON SUBS: Michael Keane, Amadou Onana, Asmir Begovic, Dele Alli, Seamus Coleman, Tom Davies, Ruben Vinagre, Salomon Rondon.   ', '   Steven Gerrard has made two changes to his Villa side, with Mings coming back into the team and he replaces Konsa at centre-back, meanwhile Watkins replaces Bailey in attack.   ', '   Frank Lampard has also made two changes and both come in defence, with Ben Godfrey and Yerry Mina both out injured, so in come Holgate and Coady, the latter of whom recently joined Everton on a loan deal from Wolves.   ', '   The teams are out on the pitch and kick-off is just a few minutes away, stay tuned for all the match action!   ', ""  1'  We're under way!   "", ""  2'  Villa win a corner start away, as Cash gets forward down the right wing and he tries to whip a cross into the box, but Iwobi gets in the way and makes a good block. The set piece comes in and Carlos meets it at the far post, but his header flies over the crossbar. Decent chance.   "", ""  4'  Villa have started well and are going on the attack straight away, but they haven’t done anything to trouble the Everton defence just yet.   "", ""  6'  This is better from Everton, they are getting on the ball a bit more after having to sit back in the opening few minutes. However, much of it is in their own half.   "", ""  8'  Everton try and play it out from the back and almost lose possession inside their own half, with Pickford being played a testing ball back to him. However, the just manage to keep it and prevent any Villa opportunity.   "", ""  10'  This is the first managerial meeting between Gerrard and Lampard, who started 59 matches alongside one another for England, and were on opposite sides for 20 Premier League matches as players; Lampard won 10 of those, with seven wins for Gerrard (D3).   "", ""  12'  The hot conditions here seemed to be having an effect on the game as it is very slow so far, with neither team really trying to take the game by the scruff of the neck.   "", ""  14'  Coady and Tarkowski look like a comfortable pairing at centre-back for Everton, two former captains at their previous clubs and players with tonnes of experience in the Premier League.   "", ""  16'  Gordon does well down the left wing and goes up against Mings and tries to get into the penalty area, but the defender steps across him and puts an arm on his chest which stops the winger. However, the referee doesn’t see much in it and nothing is given.   "", ""  18'  Cash constantly looks a threat down the right wing for Villa, providing some extra width. However, Mykolenko has defended well against him so far.   "", ""  20'  It looks like Everton are sitting deep to soak up the pressure and then they'll try and break forward quickly on the counter-attack at the other end.   "", ""  22'  Everton get into a good position in the final third after winning the ball back deep inside the Villa half. However, McNeil’s through ball to Gray is poor and the chance goes away. A better pass from McNeil and that would have set up a really good opportunity for his team-mate.   "", ""  24'  GOAL RULED OUT! Everton thought they had gone ahead, but the offside flag goes up! An Everton corner goes in from the right wing and Tarkowski flicks it on in the middle and Gordon smashes it into the back of the net from close range. However, it looks like Digne just managed to get out in the nick of time and Gordon is caught offside. So it remains 0-0.   "", ""  26'  We've got a stoppage in play here for the first drinks break of the game, so it gives both teams an opportunity to receive some fresh instructions from the sidelines.   "", ""        Philippe Coutinho   Yellow Card               29'  The first yellow card of the game is shown to Coutinho after he drags Patterson down as the Everton man looked to break away.

Everton lose possession in the Villa half and the hosts counter quickly, with Watkins receiving the ball deep down the right wing, he cuts inside and passes to Ings. The striker takes it off the toes of Coutinho, turns and then fires a superb strike into the left corner of the net. Villa lead 1-0!   "", ""        O.

Doucouré               34'  Here is the enforced substitution, as Doucoure heads off and on comes Davies.

The home side have looked the better team so far, with Everton causing their own problems at the back at times, but Villa have also looked shaky at set pieces themselves. Gordon thought he had opened the scoring for Everton early on, but he had strayed into an offside position, so the goal was ruled out for offside.   ', '   Everton could look to test Villa at set pieces in the second period, that looks like a good way to fashion some chances. However, they need to tighten things up themselves at the back, as Villa could go on and score a few more, as Watkins and Ings look lively in attack.   ', ""  46'  The second half is under way!   "", ""  46'  Decent chance! The ball falls nicely to McGinn on the edge of the Everton penalty area, but his effort flies high over the crossbar and doesn't trouble Pickford.   "", ""  48'  Wasted opportunity! Watkins finds space down the right wing and seems to get stuck in two minds whether to cross to Ings, or drag it back to Ramsey on the edge of the box. He opts for the latter, but Davies gets into a good position and makes the block.   "", ""        L. Digne   Yellow Card               49'  Digne is booked after Patterson beats him down the right wing and looks to race into the box, but the Villa left-back pulls him down.   "", ""  51'  This is much more promising from Everton, they are playing better and are seeing more of the ball in the Villa half. However, they are yet to test Martinez in goal.   "", ""  53'  SAVE! Gray manages to get away from Cash and he cuts inside and fires a powerful shot at goal, but it's too close to Martinez, who makes a strong stop.   "", ""  55'  Everton won just two away Premier League games in 2021-22, their fewest in a season since 2003-04 (1), while the Toffees lost 13 games on the road, their most since 2000-01 (also 13).   "", ""  57'  Everton do have Rondon on the bench if Lampard wants to change things and put a recognised striker on the pitch. At the moment, they have Gray, Gordon and McNeil as an attacking front three.   "", ""  59'  There's an injury concern here for Villa, as Coutinho is receiving some treatment on the pitch and Buendia might be the one to replace him if he can't continue.   "", ""        E. Buendía   Philippe Coutinho               60'  Here is the enforced Villa change, with Coutinho having to come off and Buendia is his replacement.

On come the Everton physios, but he should be fine to continue.   "", ""        S. Rondón   D. McNeil               64'  Everton change coming up, with McNeil making way for Rondon.   "", ""  67'  CHANCE! Villa work it well in the final third and Ings works space for a shot in the box, but Buendia takes it off his toes and tries to turn and fire an attempt himself. However, he runs into trouble and Everton clear the danger in the nick of time.   "", ""  69'  There's still plenty of time left on the clock for Everton to get back into the game, but Villa are dominating at the moment and look more dangerous. So something needs to change for the visitors.   "", ""  71'  Another drinks break stoppage now, which has come at an ideal time for Everton as they haven't been able to do much in the final third recently.   "", ""  73'  Blocked! Carlos fires a powerful shot at goal and it appears to be heading on target, but Patterson gets across and makes a strong block to prevent a possible goal.   "", ""  74'  OFF THE LINE! Buendia thought he had made it two with a volley from the edge of the six-yard box after Everton failed to clear the danger and his effort looks to be heading into the top right corner of the net. However, Mykolenko gets into a good position and clears it off the line.   "", ""        D. Ings   Yellow Card               75'  Ings is the latest player to be booked.   "", ""  76'  Everton lost their opening Premier League match for the first time since 2011-12 – they’ve lost both of their opening two league games in just one of the last 31 top-flight campaigns, doing so in 2009-10.   "", ""        L. Bailey   D. Ings               78'  Villa substitution coming up now, with Ings the man to head off the pitch and on comes Bailey.   "", ""        D. Alli   C.

Gray               81'  Gray is the other to head off and on comes Onana.   "", ""  83'  Time is starting to run out for Everton to find an equaliser in this game, with Villa dominating and they look pretty comfortable.   "", ""        E. Buendía   Goal               86'  GOAL! Buendia makes it 2-0! The substitute has been excellent since coming on and has doubled Villa's lead! Everton lost the ball deep inside their own half and Villa counter quickly, with Buendia laying it off to Watkins, who then drills a low cross into the six-yard box and Buendia converts from close range.   "", ""        O. Watkins   Assist               86'  Watkins could have gone for goal himself, but instead opted to pass to his team-mate, who couldn't miss from just a few yards out.

Onana hasn't been on the pitch for long, but he does brilliantly down the left and plays a lovely cross into a dangerous area in the box and Digne doesn't sort out his feet quickly enough and he turns the ball into the back of his own net. Game on!   "", ""  88'  SAVE! Watkins finds space down the left and he only has Pickford to beat after being played through on goal. However, the keeper races off his line and does brilliantly to smother the shot.   "", ""  90'  There will be a minimum of five minutes added time played at the end of the second half.   "", ""  90' + 1'  CHANCE! Gordon races through on goal and forces Martinez into making a good stop, but the rebound flies straight into the middle of the box and Rondon tries to meet it, but Mings gets back and makes a superb tackle to prevent a goal.

The two-goal lead didn’t last long though as Everton pegged them back just two minutes later, after Onana forced Digne to turn the ball into the back of his own net and the visitors then threw everything at Villa to try and make it 2-2, with Gordon and Onana both going close. However, they couldn’t find an equaliser in time and Villa hung on for a 2-1 win.   ', '   Villa get their first points of the season on the board and they will face Crystal Palace next time out.

West Ham break down the left flank and Benrahma works a cutback inside for Soucek to fire towards goal. It appears destined for the bottom-left corner, but McKenna diverts it wide of the left post.   "", ""  63'  VAR! PENALTY TO WEST HAM! McKenna blocked the strike from Soucek with his arm and the referee has no alternative but to point to the spot.   "", ""        S. McKenna   Yellow Card               64'  McKenna is saved from a red card for his handball that results in the spot-kick, but he does get a yellow card.   "", ""        D. Rice   Penalty Miss               65'  MISS! Rice takes the spot-kick for the Hammers, but he telegraphs his effort low and to the left. Henderson reads it all the way and makes the stop. A huge moment in the game.   "", ""        D. Henderson   Penalty Save               65'  SAVED! Henderson continues his excellent game with a fine stop to deny Rice. He anticipates that the West Ham skipper will strike to his left and guesses the right way to make a comfortable save.   "", ""  66'  CHANCE! Niakhate has a huge change to extend Forest's lead, but he spurns the opening. The home side win a free-kick in the final third that Williams angles to the back post. It falls perfectly for Niakhate, but he does not anticipate it reaching him and he steers a tame effort at Fabianski.   "", ""  68'  Antonio fends off Toffolo and turns inside the Forest box, but as he strikes at goal, McKenna gets across to make an important block.   "", ""        M. Lanzini   Pablo Fornals               68'  Lanzini enters the fold to replace Fornals, who came extremely close to dragging West Ham level.   "", ""        G. Scamacca   M. Antonio               68'  Antonio bows out of the contest and is replaced in the final third by Scamacca.   "", ""  70'  Play is stopped for a cooling break.   "", ""        S. Surridge   T. Awoniyi               72'  The Forest goalscorer is withdrawn from the action as Awoniyi makes way for Surridge.   "", ""  72'  We're back under way at the City Ground.   "", ""        D. Henderson   Yellow Card               75'  Henderson is booked for time-wasting from a goal-kick.   "", ""  76'  Scamacca finds space in the inside-left channel after breaking past Niakhate. He shapes to shoot, but sees the path to goal blocked. The forward turns back onto his right foot, but his effort is blocked.   "", ""  77'  Niakhate is struggling with an apparent hamstring problem after losing out to Scamacca. He requires treatment before the game can continue.   "", ""        S. Cook   M. Niakhaté               79'  Cook replaces the struggling Niakhate at the back. Forest will hope that his injury is not a severe one.   "", ""  80'  Brennan Johnson does well down the right flank with a strong run, and he wins a corner off the legs off Ben Johnson.   "", ""  81'  Cresswell breaks forward and tries to pick out Scamacca in the box with a ball over the top, but it travels through to Henderson.   "", ""  83'  OFF THE LINE! It is not West Ham's day in front of goal. Cresswell lifts a corner into the box for Zouma to attack and his header seems destined for the bottom-left corner. However, Williams is in the right place at the right time to clear his effort off the line.   "", ""        Cafú   O. Mangala               84'  Mangala is withdrawn for the home side and is replaced by Cafu.   "", ""        M. Cornet   J. Bowen               85'  Cornet makes his Hammers bow as he replaces Bowen.

"", ""  88'  Brennan Johnson bursts into the inside-left channel and forces a low ball across the face of goal that Fabianski does well to gather.   "", ""  89'  BLOCK! Benrahma continues to be a thorn in the side of Worrall. He runs at the Forest skipper before finding Lanzini, who sees his strike deflected wide of the left post.   "", ""  90'  Soucek tries to attack a corner from Cresswell, but under pressure from Toffolo, he can only bundle his effort wide.   "", ""  90'  There will be seven minutes of added time.   "", ""  90' + 2'  Williams takes a blow and goes down. He regains his composure after a period on the deck to allow play to resume.

"", ""  90' + 9'  FULL-TIME: NOTTINGHAM FOREST 1-0 WEST HAM UNITED   "", ""   Nottingham Forest secure their first Premier League victory of the season by beating West Ham United 1-0 at the City Ground. Taiwo Awoniyi's goal was enough to secure the three points for the home side, although they had to ride their luck at times. The Hammers will not believe they lost the game as Said Benrahma had a goal disallowed by VAR and then struck the bar in the second half. Pablo Fornals also hit the bar before Tomas Soucek was denied by Dean Henderson. To cap it off, Declan Rice missed a penalty after Scott McKenna was penalised for handball. It was not always pretty from Forest, but Steve Cooper and his team will not care one bit.   "", '   Forest have momentum now to take into their Premier League clash with Everton next Saturday. West Ham return to the London Stadium in their first Europa Conference League contest against Viborg on Thursday.   ', '   Thanks for joining our commentary today. Until next time, goodbye.   ']"
