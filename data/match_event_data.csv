', '   In the final round of Premier League fixtures before the World Cup takes place, rock-bottom Wolves have the toughest task of all, facing Arsenal, who sit atop the pile in first place. The hosts have lost their of their last four, and newly-appointed head coach Julen Lopetegui doesn’t start in his role until November 14th.   ', '   Arsenal, meanwhile, are flying, having won their last two games without conceding a goal while scoring six at the other end. With nearest rivals Manchester City having lost their most recent fixture to Brentford, Mikel Arteta’s Gunners have the chance to move five points clear of the chasing pack with a win in the West Midlands.   ', '   WOLVES (5-3-2): Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Maximilian Kilman, Nathan Collins, Tote Gomes, Hugo Bueno; Boubacar Traore, Ruben Neves, Joao Moutinho; Adama Traore, Goncalo Guedes.   ', '   WOLVES SUBS: Matija Sarkic, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Daniel Podence, Yerson Mosquera, Connor Ronan, Matheus Nunes, Joseph Hodge, Chem Campbell, Dexter Lembikisa.   ', '   ARSENAL (4-3-3): Aaron Ramsdale; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.   ', '   ARSENAL SUBS: Matt Turner, Kieran Tierney, Eddie Nketiah, Rob Holding, Cedric Soares, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson, Mohamed Elneny, Marquinhos.   ', '   Wolves make two changes from their League Cup victory over Leeds in midweek, with Adama Traore back in the side, playing on the right of a front two. It’s five at the back too for the hosts, with Tote Gomes slotting in at the back.   ', '   Arsenal are unchanged from their last league outing, a 1-0 win over Chelsea, with Arteta not tempted to tinker with the XI that many see as his strongest. Gabriel Magalhaes got the winner at Stamford Bridge, and is part of a back four that have conceded just 11 goals so far this season, the joint-lowest in the league.   ', ""   The teams head out onto the Molineux pitch, and we're nearly ready for kick-off here!   "", ""  1'  Jesus kicks off for Arsenal, and we are off and running in the West Midlands!   "", ""  3'  Play halts early on, and Arsenal put the ball out. It's Xhaka who is down, and doesn't look injured, so the midfielder could indeed be feeling unwell at the start of this game.   "", ""  4'  Xhaka is cleared to continue playing and returns to the pitch, meaning the game can get underway again!   "", ""  5'  Arsenal have won six of their eight Premier League away games against Wolves, and have scored at least once in all 16 of their meetings with them in the competition.   "", ""  6'  BALL IN THE NET!!! Martinelli cuts inside and crosses beyond Tote. Jesus is onto it, and smashes a half-volley into the bottom corner, but the flag is up to deny the Brazilian his sixth goal of the season!   "", ""  7'  CHANCE!!! Wolves play through Arsenal's high line and Boubacar Traore has it on the right. He passes centrally to Guedes, but Ramsdale's out to deny him, and Adama Traore's rebound is blocked by Saliba!   "", ""  9'  Wolves lost home and away against Arsenal in the league last season, having lost just two of their previous eight against them.   "", ""  11'  A ball over the top bounces Jesus' way, and he turns Kilman looking to shoot, but a good defensive header from Tote gets the ball back to Sa in the Wolves goal.   "", ""  13'  Semedo wins Wolves' first corner of the game, and after playing a one-two with Moutinho, Guedes crosses, but it takes a deflection off White and goes out for another corner.   "", ""  14'  Saka has it on the byline and whips an early cross towards the front post. It takes a nick off Tote on its way through, leaving Sa scrambling as he tips it behind for a corner!   "", ""  15'  Saka's corner is flicked on by Gabriel in the centre of the box, but his glancing header isn't powerful enough and skews well wide!   "", ""        Fábio Vieira   G. Xhaka               16'  Xhaka does eventually come off having pulled up with illness earlier in the game, and Fabio Vieira is called from the bench to replace him.   "", ""  18'  Arsenal are the only side to have scored in every Premier League game this season, while they've also got the joint-fewest goals conceded and joint-most clean sheets so far, with 11 and six respectively. The Gunners are looking to win three consecutive league games without conceding for the first time since July 2020.   "", ""  19'  Semedo looks to find Adama Traore with a long ball behind the defence, but the Wolves forward doesn't time his run and would've been offside if he'd collected it.   "", ""  20'  OVER!!! After Martinelli slips over, Wolves race down the right on the counter and it's played forward to Guedes. He surges towards the box before pulling the trigger, and sends a decent effort inches over the bar!   "", ""  22'  As well as having the fewest goals (eight) and lowest shot conversion rate (4.8 per cent) in the league this season, Wolves have had fewer different goalscorers than any other side, with just four. Neves has netted half of their eight goals so far this term.   "", ""  23'  WIDE!! White's cross from the right is aimed towards Martinelli, but a good Semedo header takes the ball away from him. Zinchenko crosses the ball back into the box, where Jesus' glancing header flashes just wide!   "", ""  25'  Arsenal have scored in each of their last 29 meetings with Wolves in all competitions since a 1-0 loss back in February 1979. Only against West Bromwich Albion (32) are the Gunners currently on a longer scoring streak in all competitions.   "", ""  27'  Bueno does well to dispossess Odegaard as the Arsenal captain tries to create crossing space, and the young Wolves wing-back also frustrates White after the England defender fails to win a corner.   "", ""  29'  Moutinho looks to move forward on the counter for Wolves, but he's dragged back by Odegaard. The Arsenal midfielder is penalised, but not booked, in a decision which the home fans aren't exactly happy with.   "", ""  31'  Arsenal have had three players sent off in their last two league away games in Wolverhampton, with Martinelli seeing red last season, and both David Luiz and Bernd Leno doing so in the same game February 2021.   "", ""  33'  A long throw-in from Partey is launched into the Wolves box, and Neves has to head it beyond for a corner to prevent the chance progressing any further!   "", ""  35'  Boubacar Traore's superb run sparks a Wolves counter-attack, but the final ball from Moutinho to Guedes is cut out! He would've been through on goal there!   "", ""  36'  OFF THE BAR!!! Arsenal take advantage of Wolves committing men forward and Saka puts Jesus in behind. He narrows the angle before shooting with his right, and smashes the ball beyond Sa, but off the bar and over!   "", ""        Toti   Yellow Card               37'  Neves loses the ball on the edge of Arsenal's box and Jesus bursts forward with it, but he's tripped on halfway by Tote, who is booked by the referee.   "", ""  39'  Wolves have won just one of their last eight Premier League games, drawing one and losing six. They've conceded at least three goals in four of these eight games, as many times as they had in their previous 49 matches in the competition.   "", ""  40'  WIDE!!! White floats a cross to the back post with red and white shirts queuing up, but Jesus mistimes his finish and side-foots a volley wide of the target!   "", ""  41'  Guedes looks to turn Gabriel but goes down on the edge of the box. He's fuming to have not been given one, as Adama Traore collects the ball and blasts well over from the edge of the box!   "", ""  43'  Forward come Arsenal again as White's throw-in is only half-cleared. It's squared to Vieira on the edge of the box, but Wolves have plenty at the back and Collins blocks the effort!   "", ""  44'  BLOCKED!!! Saliba passes back to no-one, and Guedes races onto it, shooting for the far corner from just inside the box, and his effort needs a good block from Gabriel to put it behind for a corner!   "", ""  45'  We'll play two minutes of added time to close out the first half.   "", ""        B. Traoré   Yellow Card               45' + 1'  Jesus advances down the left for Arsenal and cuts inside towards the box, but he's stopped before he can get there as Boubacar Traore drags him down, and the Wolves midfielder is booked.   "", ""  45' + 2'  HALF-TIME: WOLVES 0-0 ARSENAL.   "", ""   A goalless first half comes to an end, and it's not exactly been a match for the ages. The two sides have both played quite reserved football, and the defences are definitely on top at the moment. Arsenal have had the ball in the net, but only from Jesus in an offside position. With that goal not given, chances were few and far between, with neither Sa nor Ramsdale forced into a serious save. The second half should see the game open up a bit more, with the cagey start to the match hopefully giving way to some goals!   "", ""   Jesus' goalscoring drought hasn't been broken in that first half, but the Brazil forward has shown why he's so important all across the pitch for Arsenal. He's held the ball up superbly well for the Gunners, winning six of his nine duels, with half of these coming in the air. He's completed every pass he's made in the final third, and has also won possession back three times, via a tackle, clearance and interception apiece. Active.   "", ""   The teams return for the second half, and here's hoping we see some goals in the next 45 minutes!   "", ""  46'  Neves resumes proceedings for Wolves, and we're back underway at Molineux!   "", ""  47'  Arsenal have won all three of their Premier League games so far this season when going into half time level - they last had a longer such run between August and October 2018, a run of seven.   "", ""  48'  CHANCE!!! Collins heads Odegaard's cross clear and Wolves burst forward on the break. Adama Traore passes wide to Guedes, who is in open space. He crosses to the back post, where Adama Traore has run for the return ball, but Ramsdale gets down to smother the ball before it reaches him!   "", ""  50'  Semedo is clipped late by Partey, but the referee plays advantage with Adama Traore on the ball. He floats one towards Guedes in the box, but Gabriel intercepts for the Gunners!   "", ""  51'  Arsenal have stopped the opposition from scoring a first-half goal in 11 of their 14 games so far this season, with only Newcastle doing so more often (13 times) in the Premier League.   "", ""        T. Partey   Yellow Card               52'  Following that foul on Semedo, the referee comes back to book Partey for his off-the-ball challenge on the Wolves right-back.   "", ""  54'  Wolves failed to score a first-half goal for the 10th time this season. In the 15 games so far, only West Ham and Everton (both 11) have failed to score more often league.   "", ""        Fábio Vieira   Assist               54'  The ball from Jesus was exquisite, and Vieira's timing of run and awareness to find his teammates was just as good!   "", ""        M. Ødegaard   Goal               54'  GOOOAAALLL!!! Arsenal take the lead!! Jesus cut inside from the left before threading a delightful ball through for Vieira, and he squares it across the face of goal where Odegaard and Saka are waiting to tap it home! Odegaard gets the crucial touch, and that well-worked finish puts Arsenal 1-0 up with 10 gone in the second half!   "", ""  57'  Arsenal have now scored nine goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the Premier League this season.   "", ""  59'  Semedo blasts a ball into the box, but the midriff of Martinelli gets in the way, deflecting the ball out over the sideline as the Brazilian wreathes in pain on the floor!   "", ""        Gabriel Magalhães   Yellow Card               60'  Adama Traore gets beyond Saliba and sprints down the left towards the box. Gabriel slides in recklessly, catching the forward right on the edge of the area, and he's booked for the foul that could well have ended up being a penalty rather than free-kick!   "", ""  61'  SAVED!!! From the free-kick, Guedes blasts a low shot to the near post, but Ramsdale sees it all the way and does well to hold the shot!   "", ""  62'  CHANCE!!! Vieira flicks White's cross on to Martinelli, whose ball back across the face is parried away by Sa. Odegaard volleys the rebound goalwards, but Tote gets in the way and Wolves scramble it clear!   "", ""  64'  Victory for Arsenal will mean they are top of the Premier League table at Christmas for the first time since 2007-08. However, the Gunners haven't gone on to win the title in any of the last five times they've topped the table at Christmas (1951-52, 1986-87, 1989-90, 2002-03 and 2007-08), last doing so in 1947-48.   "", ""  65'  CHANCE!!! Jesus is found in space and takes on Collins. He resists shooting though, instead squaring for Odegaard, and Kilman puts it behind for a corner!   "", ""  67'  Collins gets forward to win a header and he links up with Adama Traore. He bursts past two before crossing from the byline, but Ramsdale is out to pluck the teasing ball out of the air.   "", ""        Daniel Podence   João Moutinho               68'  Moutinho comes off in Wolves' first change, and he's replaced by Daniel Podence, making his first appearance for the side since picking up an injury in August.   "", ""        D. Lembikisa   Nélson Semedo               68'  Semedo also comes off having picked up a knock, and Dexter Lembikisa, making his Premier League debut, replaces him.   "", ""  69'  Podence chips over the top for Adama Traore, but Gabriel's cushioned header sends the ball back to Ramsdale. The Wolves forward can't stop in time though, and collides with the Arsenal goalkeeper in the box!   "", ""  70'  Ramsdale is given treatment following that knock from Adama Traore, and he's eventually passed fit and play continues.   "", ""  72'  Arsenal are now the only side in the Premier League this season to have scored in each of their league games, doing so now in all 14.   "", ""  73'  Guedes cuts in-field but is crowded out by Arsenal defenders. However, play is brought back for a free-kick in Guedes' favour, due to a shirt pull on his from White.   "", ""        M. Ødegaard   Goal               75'  GOOOOAAAALLL!!! The Gunners make it two!!! Martinelli beats Lembikisa before finding Zinchenko, whose near-post cross is half-cleared. Martinelli stabs it goalwards, but this too is denied, until the ball drops to Odegaard who lashes it into the bottom corner!! 2-0 to Arsenal, and their captain has really made the difference in this second half!   "", ""  77'  Podence's throughball finds Guedes with space in the box, but the Portuguese winger chooses to shoot from a tight angle, and sprays his shot well wide of goal!   "", ""  78'  Guedes does brilliantly to flick the ball over Saliba's head before racing to the edge of the box. He looks to shoot, but takes too long, allowing Gabriel to step in with a vital intervention and win the ball!   "", ""  79'  Martinelli's far-post cross is headed away by Tote, but White follows in from the edge of the box, dragging his volley wide of the far post!   "", ""        Matheus Nunes   Toti               80'  Wolves look to their attacking options late on, as centre-back Tote is withdrawn for creative midfielder Matheus Nunes.   "", ""  82'  Adama Traore takes on Partey in the box before laying it back to his namesake Boubacar, who hits a first-time shot towards goal and curls it wide of Ramsdale's right-hand post!   "", ""  84'  CHANCE!!! Zinchenko's slip allows Adama Traore space to burst into the box, but the cut-back for his teammates is woeful and finds only open space!   "", ""  85'  Arsenal counter as Jesus holds up the ball before freeing up Saka. He races down the right and finds Jesus with a return ball, but it's put behind for a corner by Collins!   "", ""  86'  WIDE!!! From Arsenal's corner, Wolves launch a counter-attack of their own as Adama Traore surges into open pasture. He hangs a cross from the byline towards Podence, who brings the ball down, flicks it up again, and fires an acrobatic bicycle kick towards goal and wide!   "", ""  87'  Matheus glides through midfield before spotting the diagonal run of Podence into the box, but his throughball is dived upon by Ramsdale for Arsenal!   "", ""  89'  SAVED!!! Adama Traore runs into the area before finding Podence to his right, and his first-time shot is too hot for Ramsdale to handle as he tips it behind for a corner!   "", ""  90'  Adama Traore's cross from a short corner is headed clear, but Neves attempts an audacious shot back in on the volley, which clears the crossbar by some distance!   "", ""  90' + 1'  We're into four minutes of added time as Arsenal look to close out yet another victory in this game.   "", ""        R. Nelson   B. Saka               90' + 1'  Mikel Arteta makes a triple sub in the last few moments, with Saka coming off for Reiss Nelson on the right flank.   "", ""        Mohamed Elneny   Fábio Vieira               90' + 1'  Fabio Vieira, who came on right at the start for the ill Xhaka, is substituted again, and Mohamed Elneny replaces him.   "", ""        Cédric Soares   O. Zinchenko               90' + 1'  Zinchenko also comes off at left-back, and Cedric Soares comes on for the rest of the game.   "", ""        Hugo Bueno   Yellow Card               90' + 2'  Bueno knocks Nelson to the ground as the two contest a bouncing ball from Cedric's clearance, and the Wolves wing-back is booked late on.   "", ""  90' + 4'  FULL-TIME: WOLVES 0-2 ARSENAL.   "", ""   Two second-half goals from captain Martin Odegaard seal the win for Arsenal, which sends them five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table! Odegaard's opening strike, a tap in from inches out, didn't exactly open the floodgates, but Wolves did have chances of their own through Guedes and Podence. Odegaard smashed in a second late in the game though, consigning the hosts to being bottom of the table at Christmas; a table that his Gunners will be sitting on top of over the World Cup break.   "", ""   Odegaard managed three shots on target, scoring Arsenal's match-winning goals with two of them. The Norwegian was busy in the middle of the park, winning possession seven times, one of which came in Wolves' own defensive third. He made a sole tackle, but also conceded two free-kicks, giving a reflection on how scrappy and competitive the midfield battle was at Molineux.   "", ""   A seventh defeat in nine games leaves Wolves in last place going into the World Cup, and new boss Julen Lopetegui has plenty of work to do over the break in order for the side to recover. They're four points clear of safety after 15 games, which despite being bleak, is far from an insurmountable task. Arsenal, meanwhile, are five clear at the summit, and head into the remainder of the season as the team to beat. Could the Gunners' first title win since 2004 really be on the cards?   "", ""   That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game. Until next time, goodbye!   ""]"

Ronaldo flicks it to Fernandes, who lays it straight back to the forward. He takes on the shot from range, but it's straight at Raya.   "", ""  6'  Jensen's long throw-in causes United a few problems and it pinballs through the box. Mee manages to touch it towards Toney in the middle, but Eriksen forces him wide before giving away the corner.   "", ""  8'  Shaw goes for the big switch out to Sancho on the right and he brings it down while holding off Henry. He squares it to Fernandes, who tries to help it out to Shaw, but his touch gets away from him.   "", ""        J. Dasilva   Goal               10'  DASILVA SCORES! And it's a moment to forget for De Gea! It comes from United's throw-in and Ronaldo loses out to Jensen. He squares it to Dasilva, and the United players are slow to close him down so he has a go from range. It's low to De Gea's near post and it flies straight through his hands and into the bottom corner. 1-0 Brentford!   "", ""        M. Jensen   Assist               10'  Jensen didn't win the original header against Ronaldo, but he got a foot in with a good challenge to win it back.   "", ""  12'  CHANCE! United work it upfield quickly as they try to get straight back into this game and Shaw fizzes it across the edge of the box. Sancho touches it into Fernandes, who hits the shot first time and fires it high into the stands.   "", ""  14'  Ronaldo is urging his team-mates to calm down as they seem a bit shaky after conceding the opener. Brentford work it upfield well again and Mbuemo has a go from range, but it's well blocked by Maguire.   "", ""        H. Maguire   Yellow Card               16'  Eriksen's first touch bounces straight off Jensen and Maguire slides in to stop Dasilva from running straight at goal. He's shown the first yellow card of the game.   "", ""  17'  CLOSE! Jensen steps up to take the free-kick on the edge of the D and it's a good effort. He whips it over the wall and it sails just over De Gea's crossbar.   "", ""        M. Jensen   Goal               18'  JENSEN SCORES! And United are falling apart here! Martinez takes the goal-kick short to De Gea and he touches it out to Eriksen who is caught on the ball by Jensen again. He quickly turns into space before slotting it into the near bottom corner. 2-0 Brentford!   "", ""  20'  CHANCE! United are still playing out from the back and Dalot carries it forward this time. He links up with Fernandes, who tees Ronaldo up for another chance from range, but this one sails over the bar.   "", ""  22'  Shaw's cross is just out of everyone's reach but Sancho tries to recycle it on the far side. Brentford double up on him though and his cross is blocked at the byline.   "", ""  24'  Sancho's persistence pays off as he nicks it off Dasilva in the centre circle and he touches it through to Rashford, who sees a shot blocked. United keep it alive with Dalot on the edge of the box, but his low effort is straight at Raya.   "", ""  26'  The players make their way to the touchline for the first cooling break, and both managers are using the opportunity to pass on their messages for the rest of the half.   "", ""  28'  Brentford have another free-kick in a good position here after Norgaard is clipped by Fernandes. Norgaard whips it in and De Gea stretches to push it off his line.   "", ""  30'  Another free-kick for Brentford, on the opposite wing this time, is curled in by Jensen and it causes some confusion in the box. Maguire holds off Jansson to be able to flick it away.   "", ""        B. Mee   Goal               30'  MEE SCORES! The resulting corner is swung deep into the box and Toney has acres of space as he nods it back across the goal line. Mee trips as he runs towards goal and on his way to ground, it skims off his head and hits the back of the net. 3-0 Brentford!   "", ""        I. Toney   Assist               30'  Toney's late run was picked up by none of the United players and he nodded it back into a dangerous area to set up the goal.   "", ""  32'  There was a VAR check on the goal for a possible offside, but it will stand and that decision gets another big cheer from the Brentford fans. They're enjoying this one!   "", ""  34'  Sancho squeezes the ball forward to Eriksen down the right and he sees a cross blocked from close range. He's claiming there was a handball from Jansson, but the referee waves the claims away.   "", ""        B. Mbeumo   Goal               35'  MBUEMO SCORES! United were enjoying a good attack at the other end, but Brentford punished them as soon as they won possession back. Toney latches onto the long ball upfield and instantly plays it to the edge of the box for Mbuemo. He outmuscles Shaw to coolly slot it into the bottom corner. 4-0 Brentford!   "", ""        I. Toney   Assist               35'  United committed a lot of bodies forward and Toney exploited the space they left in behind. His pass into Mbuemo was perfectly weighted and he has his second assist of the game.   "", ""  37'  The United players are rattled and they just don't seem to know what they're supposed to be doing. Brentford come again, with Toney trying to set up Hickey this time, but Martinez gets a foot in.   "", ""  39'  Raya came a long way out of his box to clear Fernandes' long ball and he collided with Rashford in the process. The winger is holding his shoulder, but he's okay after treatment.   "", ""  41'  Brentford are just the third team to score four goals against United in the first half of a Premier League game after Tottenham in October 2020 and Liverpool in October 2021.   "", ""  43'  Sancho can't find a way through down the right, so he touches it back to Eriksen, who tries to slide it into Ronaldo. Brentford have bodies crowded into the box though and it's blocked.   "", ""  44'  CHANCE! United are passing it around just outside Brentford's box, but can't find a way into it. Fernandes takes it around two defenders before deciding to have a go from range, but this one is over the bar as well.   "", ""  45' + 1'  Four added minutes at the end of the first half, and United are working it forward again. After a patient passage of possession, Shaw clips it into the box, but it's over everyone.   "", ""  45' + 3'  Ronaldo is tripped and United have a free-kick. It's a good cross by Eriksen this time as he curls it into the crowd, but Raya confidently rushes off his line to hold it.   "", ""  45' + 5'  HALF-TIME: BRENTFORD 4-0 MANCHESTER UNITED.   "", ""   It was a dream of a first half for Brentford, who lead Manchester United 4-0 at the break. Dasilva broke the deadlock just 10 minutes in when his low shot flew through De Gea's hands into the back of the net, and Jensen pounced onto a loose touch by Eriksen in his own box to double their lead. Mee scored his first goal for the club with a close-range header following a corner and Mbuemo added the fourth five minutes later after a lightning-quick counter-attack.   "", ""   Brentford's first goal rattled United, and they really struggled to find any sort of cohesion after it went in. They were all over the place and Ten Hag has a big half-time team talk ahead of him. You can't take anything from Brentford though, who have punished United's mistakes and they'll be high on confidence going into the second half.   "", ""        T. Malacia   L. Shaw               46'  Ten Hag is making a triple change at half-time as United try to restore some pride. Shaw is the first to go off, with Malacia replacing him.   "", ""        R. Varane   Lisandro Martínez               46'  Martinez is also making way, with Varane on in his place.   "", ""        S. McTominay   Fred               46'  And Fred is the other player not coming back out for the second half, with McTominay brought on for him.   "", ""  46'  Brentford get us back underway for the second half!   "", ""  48'  Sancho's low cross is cut out and Brentford break on the counter. Mbuemo threads it through for Henry, but Varane stands his ground to block the cross.   "", ""  50'  SAVE! Varane stoops to try and clear a corner but ends up helping it out to Toney on the far post instead. He lays it off to Norgaard, who made the overlapping run and De Gea sticks out a leg to keep him out at the near post.   "", ""  51'  CHANCE! It's better from United as Eriksen spreads play out to Dalot, who has space down the right. He curls a cross into Ronaldo, who tries to flick it towards the near post. It bounces wide, and he thumps the ground in frustration.   "", ""  52'  CLOSE! In a similar move to the last attack, Eriksen picks out Dalot on the right and he lifts a good cross into Ronaldo. He has space to leap and glances a header on, but this one is just over the bar onto the roof of the net.   "", ""  54'  Sancho plays a clever one-two with Dalot before laying it off to Ronaldo. He squares it across the box and it's too heavy for Fernandes, but Malacia runs onto it. He drills a shot on goal, but Roerslev blocks it.   "", ""  56'  United are looking to their right side in every attack now and Dalot finds himself in space again. He hits a deep cross into the box this time, but it's out of everybody's reach and it bounces harmlessly out.   "", ""  58'  Jensen goes deep with another corner and Toney initially loses his marker to make a late run to the far post again. Eriksen makes up for his mistake this time though, sprinting back to take it off his head.   "", ""        A. Elanga   J. Sancho               60'  Fourth change for United now, and it's Sancho that's replaced by Elanga.   "", ""        V. Janelt   J. Dasilva               62'  Brentford are making their first change now. Dasilva, who got the scoring started early in the first half, goes off for Janelt.   "", ""  64'  United are enjoying another good spell of possession, but Brentford are comfortable. They've dropped deep into their shape, and are making it difficult for the visitors to get through.   "", ""  66'  Including caretakers, none of the last seven managers to take charge of United have lost their first away league game at the helm (W4 D3). The last manager to lose his first such match was Alex Ferguson in 1986 (2-0 defeat at Oxford United).   "", ""  68'  SAVE! United are starting to move it a little quicker now and the attack comes down their right again. Dalot curls another good cross into the middle and Eriksen heads it on goal, but it's a comfortable save for Raya.   "", ""  70'  Brentford are happy to just drop back into their shape as United push forward again, this time down their left. Rashford swings the cross in, but nobody is in the middle and Mee heads it away.   "", ""  72'  McTominay squeezes a throughball into Ronaldo, who turns away from Janelt before having a go from the edge of the D. His shot is always rising though, and it sails over the bar.   "", ""        Y. Wissa   B. Mbeumo               73'  Brentford are making a double change here, and Mbuemo, who scored the fourth goal, goes off for Wissa.   "", ""        S. Baptiste   M. Jensen               74'  And Jensen, who also had a hand in the goals, is replaced by Baptiste.   "", ""  76'  Hickey has stayed down holding his ankle after he tracked back to his own goal and play has been stopped so he can receive treatment. He's quickly back to his feet to carry on.   "", ""  78'  Brentford win a free-kick on the right which is easily dealt with by United and Elanga threatens to break on the counter. He's pulled back by Roerslev and United are back to patiently working it upfield.   "", ""        M. Sørensen   A. Hickey               80'  Final changes for Brentford now and the players are going off to a warm reception from the home fans. Hickey is replaced by Sorensen.   "", ""        F. Onyeka   C. Nørgaard               80'  And Norgaard is the other player making way, with Onyeka on for him.   "", ""  81'  CLOSE! Malacia's cross takes a deflection off Sorensen and Eriksen does well to control it with his first touch before volleying an effort across goal. Raya is beaten, but it flashes wide of the far post.   "", ""        S. McTominay   Yellow Card               82'  McTominay's first touch gets away from him, and he kicks Onyeka in his attempt to make up for the mistake. He's shown a yellow card.   "", ""  84'  Onyeka stayed down after the tackle from McTominay and he's having treatment now. He's moving gingerly when he gets to his feet, but he'll be able to carry on.   "", ""  85'  GOOD SAVE! The corner catches United out as it's played to Wissa on the edge of the box. He drills a first-time shot into the box, through the crowd, and De Gea gets down quickly to push it away.   "", ""        D. van de Beek   C. Eriksen               87'  United's final change of the game sees Van de Beek coming on in place of Eriksen.   "", ""        M. Rashford   Yellow Card               89'  Dalot's crossfield pass is loose and Baptiste is surging forward on the counter. Rashford tracks back and takes one for the team by bringing him down, resulting in a yellow card.   "", ""  90' + 1'  United are still looking for a late consolation, but it's crowded in midfield. McTominay tries to spread it out to the left but plays it behind Malacia which allows Brentford to get possession back.   "", ""  90' + 3'  Every Brentford pass is being greeted by a cheer by the home fans as the end of the game ticks ever closer. Toney tries to slide it through to Wissa, but Maguire steps in with an important interception.

"", ""  90' + 5'  FULL-TIME: BRENTFORD 4-0 MANCHESTER UNITED.   "", ""   Brentford's brilliant first-half display sees them beat Manchester United 4-0. The Bees were ruthless in the first half, with Dasilva opening the scoring just 10 minutes in when his shot slipped through De Gea's hands. Jensen also punished a mistake at the back, latching onto a loose touch to slot it home. Mee headed in from a corner for his first Brentford goal before Mbuemo finished off a lightning-quick counter. Their work was done and although Eriksen had a great chance for a consolation for the visitors, Brentford kept their clean sheet.   "", '   That loss sees United drop to the bottom of the table, still without a point. Next up for them is their rivals, Liverpool, at home a week on Monday. Brentford have their first win of the campaign, and they travel to Fulham for their next game.   ', ""   That's all for today, goodbye!   ""]"
