      "[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  If you're going to collide with anyone, you don't really want to collide with Adama Traore piling in at you.\n",
      "[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.400]  I don't think he could stop Leonie Traore.\n",
      "[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  Ramsdale did seem to spill the ball initially before the challenge came in.\n",
      "[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:47.400]  Of course, Arsenal have that advantage, but when you do lead like this, it then turns to how we see this victory out.\n",
      "[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:55.400]  And it was makes these moments count when there is being treated, Mikel Arteta, dressing change at Arsenal this season.\n",
      "[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:04.400]  I mean, given how the match has been, it would be a really satisfying win if they can see this through Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  Because Wolves have been a tough nut to crack.\n",
      "[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:18.400]  Really well organised discipline.\n",
      "[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:26.400]  Of course, we hope that Ramsdale is OK.\n",
      "[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:35.400]  Yeah, I think he saw Traore come in here and maybe just spills it.\n",
      "[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400]  Well, maybe not.\n",
      "[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400]  It's a hell of a thump.\n",
      "[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.400]  The spill was helped on its way.\n",
      "[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.400]  He's just gesturing that he got caught in the throat rather than the head.\n",
      "[01:12:47.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  I think that's what Ramsdale was saying.\n",
      "[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:21.400]  Well, on we go. At Molineux, Arsenal leading by a goal to nil. A goal that if it stays like this, will increase their lead at the top of the Premier League after Manchester City lost at home to Brentford in the lunchtime kick-off today.\n",

      "[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:03.400]  Knew what he was doing.\n",
      "[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:14.400]  Well, goals have been hard to come by, especially after the air, Mark.\n",
      "[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:29.400]  Fair to say he didn't like that decision.\n",
      "[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.400]  Gabriel just felt the touch and went.\n",
      "[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.400]  There's Gabriel.\n",
      "[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  Arsenal won 1-0 on this ground last season.\n",

      "[01:14:45.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  In their home game against Wolves last season, they were trailing to a late on, scored two late goals to win it.\n",

      "[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  Well, on that side, Saka, through to White, here's Erdogan, Saka again, shielding the ball well, right balance for Kaya Saka.\n",

      "[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.400]  Here's Bueno.\n",
      "[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.400]  But Ence, now they get Ence, get Ence, puts it wide.\n",
      "[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  Well, decision making, isn't it?\n",
      "[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:55.400]  And then you score those about once every 50 shots, if not more.\n",
      "[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.400]  Well, they've got injury problems, they've got suspensions as well up front.\n",
      "[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.400]  Steve Davis lacking firepower, really.\n",
      "[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:09.400]  Now against one of the meanest defences in the Premier League.\n",
      "[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.400]  It's asking a lot of this Wolves side at the moment.\n",
      "[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:21.400]  Will Arsenal push for more?\n",
      "[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  Martinelli, really came to life for that second goal.\n",
      "[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:34.400]  Looking to target this side with a teenager on the pitch for Wolves.\n",
      "[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400]  Will Mbaka try all right?\n",
      "[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.400]  The ball forward towards Guedes, lovely skill, can he finish it off?\n",
      "[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  It was a chance to see, wasn't it?\n",
      "[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  There seemed to be an opening there.\n",
      "[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.400]  Saka.\n",
      "[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:59.400]  It's nicely done from Saka, but that's a good tackle from Neves.\n",
      "[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:06.400]  A bit of support.\n",
      "[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  Neves, Saka back to his feet.\n",
      "[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  Will Mbaka try all right? Collins.\n",
      "[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.400]  Dalot trying all right, running into trouble.\n",
      "[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.400]  Kocinksienko, Fabio Vieira.\n",
      "[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.400]  Arsenal looking dangerous again.\n",
      "[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  Erdogan on a hat trick, but will he play the pass or go himself?\n",
      "[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]  He's got it back again, Erdogan.\n",
      "[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.400]  Off to party.\n",
      "[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  Martinelli.\n",
      "[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  Swings that in, Totti in the right place.\n",
      "[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:46.400]  White, never scored for Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.400]  Not about to be patient tonight, Arsenal, but that patience has paid off.\n",
      "[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.400]  Mateusz coming on, has had injury problems, he's going to replace Guedes,\n",
      "[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.400]  who had this lovely moment just a second or so ago.\n",
      "[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.400]  Yeah, lovely bit of skill.\n",
      "[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.400]  Doesn't get his shot away there.\n",
      "[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.400]  Takes another touch and the chance is gone.\n",
      "[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.400]  As Totti has gone off, excuse me.\n",
      "[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.400]  And Mateusz, on again.\n",
      "[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.400]  The man touted as one of the best players in the world by Pep Guardiola\n",
      "[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.400]  when he signed for Wolves.\n",
      "[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.400]  Still looking for his first goal for Wolves.\n",
      "[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:37.400]  Yeah, I think they're looking for their major signings in general to come good, Wolves.\n",
      "[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:45.400]  Gollins, Roald, almost there by Gabriel Jesus.\n",
      "[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.400]  That would be the one thing that Arsenal fans would love before this game is up.\n",
      "[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.400]  A Brazilian getting on a score sheet.\n",
      "[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.400]  Yeah, that would be the perfect night for them.\n",
      "[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  Seeker.\n",
      "[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:20.400]  Gollins can't find that pass.\n",
      "[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.400]  Well, it's the 14th game in for Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:31.400]  And they are closing in on a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League.\n",
      "[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.400]  What is their best ever start to a season?\n",
      "[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  It's going to be a corner for Wolves, Arsenal are defending.\n",
      "[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.400]  And they are loving it.\n",
      "[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:55.400]  A few Newcastle fans sneaked in there.\n",
      "[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.400]  Corner from Guedes.\n",
      "[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:05.400]  And he took that corner quickly.\n",
      "[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:13.400]  Mateusz.\n",
      "[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  Neves.\n",
      "[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.400]  Dama, from a nudge, stops Sienkiewicz getting that ball.\n",
      "[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.400]  Is it Dama Trieri?\n",
      "[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.400]  And he picked the pass.\n",
      "[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.400]  He can and that's not polite.\n",
      "[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]  But is it Dama Trieri?\n",
      "[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.400]  Got his first goal for the club against Brighton.\n",
      "[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:44.400]  Yeah, not from a dissimilar position, a bit closer in.\n",
      "[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.400]  Leeds, I should say, incidentally, in the Carabao Cup.\n",
      "[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  That was their last game.\n",
      "[01:24:50.400 --> 01:25:10.400]  But either way, wasn't on target.\n",
      "[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  Here's Mateusz, can he pick the pass?\n",
      "[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.400]  He has wanted it, Mateusz couldn't get the pass away, but he has got a free kick.\n",
      "[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:25.400]  Still enough time here for Wolves to make Arsenal nervous.\n",
      "[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:36.400]  Guedes.\n",
      "[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.400]  Bueno.\n",
      "[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.400]  I don't know, is that blocked by Saliva?\n"

      "[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  What a job that Benateta has done for this Arsenal side.\n",

      "[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:31.400]  Bollins, can't always be a free-flowing best, but when you're not, it's important that you do find a way, a different sort of way.\n",
      "[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  Oh, a slip from Zinchenko, a Dama Trieri.\n",
      "[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400]  Look at that.\n",
      "[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  But his team-mate's there, they couldn't do much with that one.\n",

      "[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.400]  Gabriel Jesus has gone forward, and here is Jesus.\n",
      "[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.400]  And across comes Bollins.\n",
      "[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.400]  And a kick.\n",
      "[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.400]  Reece Nelson's going to come on shortly for Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.400]  He has impressed in recent weeks when his future was in doubt.\n",
      "[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.400]  And he's got enough in recent displays to suggest he can be a part of the squad this season.\n",
      "[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400]  Yeah, Arteta speaking highly of him.\n",
      "[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.400]  I did wonder whether his future would lie elsewhere, whether he'd be able to make an impression here.\n",
      "[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.400]  But it's looking good for Matthias Sacke to take this corner for Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  Haven't committed too many forward for it, still finds Gabriel.\n",
      "[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.400]  And Guedes, a Dama Trieri, Saliba, beat it to it by Trieri.\n",
      "[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.400]  He's got somebody in the back post in Ferdinand, can he find him?\n",
      "[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.400]  He hands it, Ferdinand is there.\n",
      "[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  Here is Ferdinand, going for the spectacular.\n",
      "[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]  And it almost slipped through.\n",
      "[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:01.400]  That water green spectacular.\n",
      "[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.400]  The man who's needed a spark this season, he almost had it there.\n",
      "[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.400]  In trial he gave Saliba there about three yards.\n",
      "[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:18.400]  Saliba's no slouch, but yeah, not too far away.\n",
      "[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  There's Bill Ramsdale sticking his tongue out.\n",
      "[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  That's the confidence in this Arsenal side.\n",
      "[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400]  And Mohamed Elneny is going to come on.\n",
      "[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400]  Surprise Rob Holding's not there as well.\n",
      "[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:41.400]  Teta, a big fan of just seeing games out on his side, that's an advantage.\n",

      "[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400]  And Regeus.\n",
      "[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:52.400]  Arsenal with his two goal lead, don't need to have so many of their attacking talents on the pitch now.\n",

      "[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  You'll look to spread that across to Martinelli.\n",
      "[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.400]  And Viquisa across.\n",
      "[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.400]  With Bacar Trieri.\n",
      "[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400]  Good play from him.\n",
      "[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.400]  And across it goes to Mateus.\n",
      "[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.400]  Carries that ball well, Mateus, and slides it through, looking for Pedence.\n",
      "[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.400]  A great player as he moves with the ball, Mateus.\n",
      "[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.400]  Yeah, a little snapshot of his ability there.\n",
      "[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:28.400]  I'd like to see a bit more of that after the World Cup.\n",
      "[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400]  Oh, look.\n",
      "[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:35.400]  At the table, Alan, when it's beautiful reading for fans of Arsenal Football Club.\n",
      "[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400]  Well, it does.\n",
      "[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:43.400]  That has certainly taken that, but you know you speak to a lot of fans and they would still take top four place.\n",
      "[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:55.400]  Champions League football again, but as the season progresses, obviously we're going to have a gap now, but ambitions get a little higher, a little loftier.\n",
      "[01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:00.400]  Well, at the moment, Manchester United are the side in fifth on 23 points.\n",
      "[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.400]  Arsenal on 37.\n",
      "[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:11.400]  Manchester United have one game in hand, but it just shows already the buffer that Arsenal have even to fifth.\n",
      "[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:16.400]  Given away by Partey.\n",
      "[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.400]  Here it is, something like there, he slurred a guard.\n",
      "[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.400]  Yeah, he's been excellent, hasn't he?\n",
      "[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.400]  Real captain's performance.\n",
      "[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.400]  Saka away here.\n",
      "[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:33.400]  Wenoa across, Saka has his man, one against one, looking for Jesus, not going to happen that time.\n",
      "[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:40.400]  And Kilman, up on a run, running into trouble.\n",
      "[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.400]  Too far up the pitch there, that's Kilman.\n",
      "[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.400]  Now Partey.\n",
      "[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:53.400]  And the Ole's out from the Arsenal fans, not for the first time this season.\n",
      "[01:30:53.400 --> 01:31:04.400]  Never mind the Ole's, I think that's what he wants to get his sub short.\n",
      "[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.400]  It doesn't look like there's going to be any late drama.\n",
      "[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400]  The way things are going at the moment.\n",
      "[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:13.400]  Zinchenko giving the ball away, Adama Traore.\n",
      "[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:20.400]  Toidence, and Ramsdale up to the challenge, and he'll berate his defence now.\n",
      "[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.400]  There's Zinchenko, getting a near full.\n",
      "[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:36.400]  Last thing you want is a couple of really uncomfortable minutes at the end, having given away a goal.\n",
      "[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.400]  Zinchenko returned to the side last week against Chelsea.\n",
      "[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  Just giving the Ole's a little bit of hope here.\n",
      "[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:51.400]  Arsenal not making those substitutions when they're defending this corner.\n",
      "[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.400]  Pudence, not a great corner.\n",
      "[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.400]  Mateus, oh he struck that, a pill for handball.\n",
      "[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.400]  Here's Martinelli.\n",
      "[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.400]  Here's Pudence.\n",
      "[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.400]  That's not a good pass from Pudence, that's going to run out of play.\n",
      "[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.400]  But did that hit the arm of Martinelli?\n",
      "[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.400]  Almost lost Rupert Cartwright already there.\n",
      "[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:24.400]  Cartwright threw him back.\n",
      "[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:30.400]  He's okay.\n",
      "[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.400]  Corner taken short by Wolves.\n",

      "[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:47.400]  Would have been a boost for them before kickoff and they capitalised on it as well.\n",

      "[07:23.040 --> 07:29.040]  You'd feel more than anybody else just to whip it over that ball and keep it moving away from Henderson.\n",
      "[07:29.040 --> 07:37.040]  Marmad there, Cresswell is spotting the ball, you might suggest he's just window dressing.\n",
      "[07:37.040 --> 07:42.040]  Last West Ham game they did last season, Aaron Cresswell whips an inch-perfect free kick over the wall.\n",

      "[08:10.040 --> 08:19.040]  The biggest sin there is he didn't hit the target.\n",

      "[10:50.040 --> 11:01.040]  West Ham have strength in numbers there, but it's about being aggressive, attacking the ball when those crosses come in. They've got to keep that up West Ham.\n",
      "[11:01.040 --> 11:14.040]  Well, I was at Villa Park yesterday in the midday sun, as only certain types like at this time of year, and it was walking football in the first half. This is anything but.\n",
      "[11:14.040 --> 11:20.040]  Bowen.\n",
      "[11:20.040 --> 11:24.040]  What Forest have to be careful of, of course, it's high energy, they're committing bodies up the pitch.\n",
      "[11:24.040 --> 11:36.040]  If they get bypassed, we know the West Ham with Bowen and Fornals and Benrahma, Antonio have a quartet there that can really hurt them if you give them space to operate in.\n",
      "[11:36.040 --> 11:41.040]  So far. Ready to take this.\n",
      "[11:41.040 --> 11:48.040]  Now, Kata imposing himself, that carried quite a touch of risk about it, that challenge.\n",
      "[11:48.040 --> 12:00.040]  And it's McKenna gets there when Antonio was poised, all in wrestling between Zouma and Aouamie, and a free kick to Forest.\n",
      "[12:00.040 --> 12:04.040]  That's really good centre forward play from Aouamie.\n",
      "[12:04.040 --> 12:13.040]  Sometimes you've just got to try and protect the ball, you're not looking to turn and get away and create an opportunity to just secure possession, just wrestle Zouma, get the foul, get your team up the pitch.\n",
      "[12:13.040 --> 12:34.040]  His dad wanted him to be a doctor, but he used the university money he'd saved to fund a trip to a football academy.\n",
      "[12:34.040 --> 12:37.040]  Here's Nico Williams now for Forest.\n",
      "[12:37.040 --> 12:41.040]  Now Aouamie is the target.\n",
      "[12:41.040 --> 12:48.040]  Well Zouma and Soufak have to do more here. Aouamie, his positioning is brilliant in between the centre half and the full back.\n",
      "[12:48.040 --> 12:53.040]  Another cross into the West Ham box, just look at his positioning here, you've got Zouma watching the ball.\n",
      "[12:53.040 --> 12:56.040]  So far hasn't got round, got round on the cover.\n",
      "[12:56.040 --> 13:00.040]  So the strike is always going to get to a decent ball in and it's a wonderful ball in from Williams.\n",
      "[13:00.040 --> 13:05.040]  Just can't get over it enough, can't keep it on target, but that is an opportunity.\n",
      "[13:05.040 --> 13:11.040]  Striped has ever so well getting into that small space in between those West Ham defenders.\n",
      "[13:11.040 --> 13:17.040]  Well the top brass will be distinctly pleased with what they've seen so far.\n",
      "[13:17.040 --> 13:28.040]  And it would seem on this evidence that the considerable investment may well bear fruit for Mr Marenakis.\n",
      "[13:28.040 --> 13:40.040]  It seems that with Forest's presence in the Premier League they have now become sort of the priority ahead of Olympiacos.\n",
      "[13:40.040 --> 13:48.040]  In terms of where he's putting his cash because let's face it, he knows that a fair bit is going to come in for at least one year.\n",
      "[13:48.040 --> 13:52.040]  Williams, oh I don't want to hear you again.\n",
      "[13:52.040 --> 13:59.040]  It's sensational there, as soon as the ball goes out to Nico Williams he's on his way.\n",
      "[13:59.040 --> 14:01.040]  And he knows that Williams has got his head up and he's looking for him.\n",
      "[14:01.040 --> 14:05.040]  That's the game plan for Steve Kuber, play with width, but try and play your striker in if you can.\n",
      "[14:05.040 --> 14:34.040]  We've seen that on a couple of occasions now from Nico Williams across and then an excellent forward ball, maybe just slightly over hit.\n",
      "[14:34.040 --> 14:43.040]  So, Bowen putting a quick free kick, our knee was alert to it.\n",
      "[14:43.040 --> 14:47.040]  Four and a half hours.\n",
      "[14:47.040 --> 14:50.040]  Good work by O'Brien.\n",
      "[14:50.040 --> 14:59.040]  If he can really settle into life in the Premier League he's got just about everything you'd want from a midfield player.\n",
      "[14:59.040 --> 15:07.040]  Benrahma, Rice, thought about it, but it was useful.\n",
      "[15:07.040 --> 15:15.040]  Now's Williams, Antonio, very optimistic handball shot.\n",
      "[15:15.040 --> 15:17.040]  This is Benrahma.\n",
      "[15:17.040 --> 15:24.040]  Oh and Henderson, almost cannon supremely kindly for West Ham.\n",
      "[15:24.040 --> 15:30.040]  But the rescue act was performed by Harry Topolow.\n",
      "[15:30.040 --> 15:35.040]  Well it's brilliant defensive appreciation from Topolow, he's always goal side of his man.\n",
      "[15:35.040 --> 15:39.040]  When the ball comes off the goalkeeper he's there to react quickly, that's not by accident.\n",
      "[15:39.040 --> 15:43.040]  Sometimes the wing back can go to sleep and think defending is not my job, it absolutely is.\n",
      "[15:43.040 --> 15:49.040]  It's so far, well there was potential that Torres might have switched off there, a different corner routine.\n",
      "[15:49.040 --> 15:56.040]  Bowen, and the apart away.\n",
      "[15:56.040 --> 16:06.040]  And left footed centre back, they don't grow on trees those, and he's been a pillar at his previous clubs.\n",
      "[16:06.040 --> 16:11.040]  A couple of examples there of the attacking danger that West Ham pose.\n",
      "[16:11.040 --> 16:16.040]  The game just starting to settle, they're getting the ball, I mentioned that attacking quartet that they've got.\n",
      "[16:16.040 --> 16:39.040]  If they can start to dominate possession they will create chances with those four.\n",
      "[16:39.040 --> 16:47.040]  West Ham looking a little more at ease now.\n",
      "[16:47.040 --> 17:05.040]  Being more capable of dictating turns, but the flag up against Jarrod Bowen.\n",
      "[17:05.040 --> 17:10.040]  Topolow is a forward thinking wing back, looks to get up the pitch, get crosses in.\n",
      "[17:10.040 --> 17:16.040]  Sometimes you have to get back and help your team out defensively, it's hard work, you cover a lot of ground in that position.\n",
      "[17:16.040 --> 17:32.040]  But it's so important he's there just to nudge that ball to safety.\n",
      "[17:32.040 --> 17:40.040]  And N'Rama looking to make life difficult for Williams.\n",
      "[17:40.040 --> 17:46.040]  Then Guard.\n",
      "[17:46.040 --> 17:55.040]  Zouma in trouble, the assistant referee flagged him, deeming that Aounia fouled Zouma.\n"

      "[20:32.040 --> 20:38.040]  Thomas Sochek is a player that Forest have to be aware of, he makes those late runs into the box, doesn't play alongside Declan Rice.\n",
      "[20:38.040 --> 20:46.040]  Rice really holds the fort in central midfield, and Sochek can break into the penalty area, he's got great height as well, he'll run beyond Mikel Antonio.\n",
      "[20:46.040 --> 20:50.040]  So the Forest defenders have to be aware of the midfielders' forward runs.\n",
      "[20:50.040 --> 21:07.040]  Rice in there as well, who's probably an underestimated force in the air, but they're a very solid team, good at set-pieces at both ends.\n",

      "[24:34.040 --> 24:40.040]  It's a different story, but his runs into the box need to be tracked, he has to be picked up.\n",
      "[24:40.040 --> 24:46.040]  But threatening, and may well have more opportunities to stamp his trademark on the game.\n",

      "[25:35.040 --> 25:55.040]  The team is in a good position, it is incredibly hot down on that pitch, so for the players to play at full pelt, as they've done in the opening quarter of the game, is impressive.\n",
      "[25:55.040 --> 26:05.040]  And the team is in a good position, it is incredibly hot down on that pitch, so for the players to play at full pelt, is impressive.\n",
      "[26:05.040 --> 26:25.040]  And the team is in a good position, it is incredibly hot down on that pitch, so for the players to play at full pelt, is impressive.\n",
      "[26:25.040 --> 26:35.040]  It's a day to warm the hearts of the Forest Legends and our great friend Gary Birtles certainly falls into that category.\n",

      "[26:54.040 --> 27:09.040]  They have a history of doing some pretty impressive things as a newly promoted side, they did of course win their one and only league championship in 1978, having come up in third place.\n",
      "[27:09.040 --> 27:32.040]  It was a promotion won by a distinctly narrow margin.\n",
      "[27:32.040 --> 27:50.040]  You shouldn't forget in the mid-90s that Frank Clark brought Forest up and they finished third and had a great European run, ended by a Jürgen Klinsmann inspired Bayern Munich.\n",
      "[27:50.040 --> 28:06.040]  Dean Henderson should be doing a little bit better with the forward ball, could have dropped that easily into Brennan Johnson, just over hits it, gives the ball back to West Ham on a hot day, you need to keep the ball if at all possible.\n",
      "[28:06.040 --> 28:25.040]  If you just keep the ball and don't particularly go anywhere you're going to wear the opposition down in these conditions. Just make them run in 30 degree heat, make them run.\n",
      "[28:25.040 --> 28:41.040]  It's a team who do have a very mixed approach. That's making it a challenge for an opposition side, so many facets in which they were strong last season.\n",
      "[28:41.040 --> 28:57.040]  Here's Johnson. Fabianski reads Johnson's effort but the movement is impressive from Brennan Johnson down this right hand side, not had a lot of possession so just drifts across the pitch.\n",
      "[28:57.040 --> 29:08.040]  His team have got comfortable possession, go and join in on the other side of the pitch. Fabianski has really seen that, he's telegraphed Johnson where he's looking to put it.\n",
      "[29:08.040 --> 29:18.040]  We weren't privy to hearing the conversation during the drinks break but certainly the gestures when Steve Cooper was talking to his striker seemed to centre on the kind of movements he wants to see.\n",
      "[29:18.040 --> 29:29.040]  This is Sophal. Sochek ending up on the deck in the middle of the penalty area there.\n",
      "[29:29.040 --> 29:40.040]  A strike from Sophal is dreadful but the amount of time and space he had to, if you think about playing the ball into the box or shooting, Forrest had to step out and close him down.\n",
      "[29:40.040 --> 30:01.040]  Frank Clarke, one of those who has served Nottingham Forest in so many roles, claimed the cup that everyone craves, managed the team successfully to promotion and back to Europe and served the club as chairman as well we shouldn't forget.\n",

      "[44:05.560 --> 44:13.560]  And I can see why the foul has been given and the goal has been chalked off.\n",
      "[44:13.560 --> 44:16.560]  I have a feeling there should be too much debate about it in all honesty.\n",

      "[45:02.560 --> 45:05.560]  Now Antonio's just again run into Mangala there and I'm sure he's saying to the referee,\n",

      "[47:05.560 --> 47:09.560]  The West Ham defenders look scared to make a tackle once he gets into the penalty area.\n",
      "[47:09.560 --> 47:13.560]  And it's a real scuff of Lengard, it looks like the chance is gone.\n",
      "[47:13.560 --> 47:19.560]  But Aouni, as he's done throughout the half, has been alive, he's been aware, he's been facing the target.\n",
      "[47:19.560 --> 47:21.560]  So he's in a position to bundle that ball in.\n",
      "[47:21.560 --> 47:23.560]  And that's what he does, he just comes off him and goes in.\n",
      "[47:23.560 --> 47:30.560]  But it's because he's in that position, looking to profit, that's why he and Forrest have taken the lead.\n",
      "[47:30.560 --> 47:35.560]  They thought they'd gone behind when Benrahma took the hole, but they've cleared their heads, gone down the other end.\n",
      "[47:35.560 --> 47:37.560]  And that's a priceless goal for Steve Koonkel.\n",
      "[47:39.560 --> 47:44.560]  Well, his number nine will surely score more stylish goals as the season has gone on,\n",
      "[47:44.560 --> 47:47.560]  but he has opened his account, and it doesn't matter how you do it.\n",

      "[48:07.560 --> 48:13.560]  Yeah, whether it be goalkeepers making saves or strikers scoring goals, it's not how you score them, but that you score them.\n",
      "[48:13.560 --> 48:19.560]  Well, they go in buoyant and jubilant at the city grounds.\n",

      "[48:29.560 --> 48:35.560]  And I have to say, I recall having watched Sports Night on my top-loading VHS before school.\n",

      "[48:59.560 --> 49:02.560]  Well, Fornals is incredibly unlucky.\n",
      "[49:02.560 --> 49:04.560]  This ball is packed.\n",
      "[49:04.560 --> 49:11.560]  Henderson before he can react, but how quickly Henderson gets up on his feet to make a vitally important second save.\n",
      "[49:11.560 --> 49:12.560]  So check point.\n",
      "[49:12.560 --> 49:16.560]  So just going to nod this back into the net, making one all.\n",
      "[49:16.560 --> 49:21.560]  Blistering start to the second half, but Dean Henderson, that ability to get off the floor quickly and make a save.\n",
      "[49:21.560 --> 49:22.560]  Outstanding.\n",
      "[49:27.560 --> 49:29.560]  Well, showing his worth in one moment.\n",
      "[49:29.560 --> 49:32.560]  Well, showing his worth in one moment.\n",

      "[52:16.560 --> 52:19.560]  As they can be, but they did dig in.\n",
      "[52:19.560 --> 52:33.560]  And yes, got some fortune.\n",
      "[52:33.560 --> 52:36.560]  Grieved as he may have been on the day, Toffolo has benefited from it,\n",
      "[52:36.560 --> 52:39.560]  but he will only find Declan Rice.\n",
      "[52:44.560 --> 52:45.560]  Here's Preswell.\n",
      "[52:45.560 --> 52:47.560]  Preswell.\n",
      "[52:48.560 --> 52:49.560]  Benrahma.\n",
      "[52:52.560 --> 52:53.560]  Rice.\n",
      "[52:55.560 --> 52:56.560]  So far.\n",
      "[52:59.560 --> 53:03.560]  Fornal is popping up in an interesting position with plenty of room to work with,\n",
      "[53:03.560 --> 53:05.560]  and O'Brien there again.\n",
      "[53:07.560 --> 53:11.560]  Another example of why Luis O'Brien is so important to any team that he plays for.\n",
      "[53:11.560 --> 53:15.560]  He does so many things so well, his defensive positioning there, perfect.\n",
      "[53:18.560 --> 53:19.560]  Benrahma.\n",
      "[53:21.560 --> 53:27.560]  His best contribution to the game has counted for nothing due to others' actions.\n",
      "[53:27.560 --> 53:31.560]  It seemed to strike the armour of Sotek, and that's the decision.\n",
      "[53:36.560 --> 53:39.560]  And that's such a crisp strike from Fornals.\n",
      "[53:40.560 --> 53:43.560]  He's actually moving away from the target, he's starting to whip with the instep.\n",
      "[53:43.560 --> 53:45.560]  That brings the power, he's so unlucky not to score himself,\n",
      "[53:45.560 --> 53:47.560]  he's clearly not over the line, but hence the power.\n",
      "[53:48.560 --> 53:49.560]  And here's O'Brien.\n",
      "[53:51.560 --> 53:52.560]  O'Brien.\n",
      "[53:52.560 --> 53:56.560]  He's starting to whip with the instep, that brings the power, he's so unlucky not to score himself,\n",
      "[53:56.560 --> 54:00.560]  he's clearly not over the line, but Henderson reacts so, so quickly.\n",
      "[54:01.560 --> 54:05.560]  And Sotek, anywhere but where he actually heads it, and it's pretty much unsaveable.\n",
      "[54:06.560 --> 54:11.560]  You've got to give the goalkeeper a huge amount of credit for not just lying on the floor\n",
      "[54:11.560 --> 54:14.560]  and waiting for the inevitable, he makes a stunning save.\n",
      "[54:15.560 --> 54:17.560]  The cap came off shortly after that.\n",
      "[54:17.560 --> 54:21.560]  Decided he can dispense with it.\n",
      "[54:25.560 --> 54:31.560]  In the first half, West Ham's attack was pretty sporadic, but they've been consistent,\n",
      "[54:31.560 --> 54:35.560]  start of the second half, they know what David Moyes said to them, but they've dominated since the break.\n",
      "[54:36.560 --> 54:37.560]  And they'll be disappointed if not equalised.\n",
      "[54:38.560 --> 54:42.560]  They've been on the receiving end of it many times, I know that often just a glare will do.\n",
      "[54:42.560 --> 54:47.560]  It's better be David Moyes or Paddington-Barry, it works the same, does it?\n",
      "[54:48.560 --> 54:52.560]  Certainly works with David Moyes, surprisingly he turns to Stone on a few occasions.\n",
      "[54:54.560 --> 55:02.560]  And it's Sotek, Antonio involved again there, on the edge of the area, it's so far dealt with by Niakate.\n",
      "[55:03.560 --> 55:08.560]  There's no complaints there from Nicol Antonio, but Niakate's got to be so careful, so desperate to get to the ball,\n",
      "[55:08.560 --> 55:12.560]  he did seem to bundle through the back of the striker.\n",
      "[55:13.560 --> 55:15.560]  Oh no, it's not the ball, good boy.\n",
      "[55:17.560 --> 55:21.560]  They've really made work around picking that rock.\n",
      "[55:22.560 --> 55:26.560]  They're pushing and pulling Forrest around, there's an intensity, a zip to their play,\n",
      "[55:26.560 --> 55:28.560]  much sharper with their passing, with their movement.\n",
      "[55:28.560 --> 55:37.560]  Forrest are really at the moment just hanging on, they've got to hang in there, the next ten minutes.\n",
      "[55:41.560 --> 55:42.560]  Chamberson's.\n",
      "[55:42.560 --> 55:52.560]  Lingard.\n",
      "[55:58.560 --> 56:01.560]  It was an interesting choice for Jesse Lingard to join Nottingham Forest,\n",
      "[56:01.560 --> 56:08.560]  with that success they had last season at West Ham, I felt clearly that would tempt him back again,\n",
      "[56:08.560 --> 56:12.560]  and we'd go differently.\n",
      "[56:13.560 --> 56:17.560]  Bangalore, it was 4-4, and it bounced off set.\n",
      "[56:24.560 --> 56:31.560]  Yeah, it looks like there may have been an offside in there, no, the goal has been allowed.\n",
      "[56:31.560 --> 56:41.560]  No, the goal has been allowed, and this is turning into one of the great days for Nottingham Forest.\n",
      "[56:42.560 --> 56:46.560]  Nottingham Forest just hanging in there and keeping West Ham out.\n",
      "[56:46.560 --> 56:50.560]  They've gone down the other end and have they scored? It's a very, very tight call.\n",
      "[56:51.560 --> 56:56.560]  He does look to be ahead of that final defender, all he can do, Ben and Johnson, is took the ball home, he's done that.\n",
      "[56:56.560 --> 57:00.560]  Of course, they'll be having a good long look at this.\n",
      "[57:05.560 --> 57:10.560]  Well, Robert Jones is waiting for assistance from Stockley Park.\n",
      "[57:12.560 --> 57:16.560]  Of course, this is not a subjective decision, it's a factual one, so VAR will make the call,\n",
      "[57:16.560 --> 57:20.560]  they'll draw the lines and probably, probably disallow it.\n",
      "[57:20.560 --> 57:23.560]  Well, there's no higher power involved, I'm afraid.\n",
      "[57:23.560 --> 57:26.560]  It's just Michael Salisbury.\n",
      "[57:30.560 --> 57:40.560]  And confirmation has come from Stockley Park that that glorious moment is only a brief one,\n",
      "[57:40.560 --> 57:53.560]  that brief rush of celebration, and both sides now having a goal disallowed.\n",
      "[57:53.560 --> 58:04.560]  At this point, it's only my impression that Stockley Park is not in the stakes for a third round of closing the game and a goal from a man who has before a moment in his career.\n",
      "[58:10.560 --> 58:15.560]  Two goals from Ashim Shahe has been approved to be counted, to assume that the Men's Tennis Hall isn't caught.\n",
      "[58:15.560 --> 58:23.640]  Nico Williams.\n",
      "[58:23.640 --> 58:40.120]  You should get out there by my right-hand side.\n",
      "[58:40.120 --> 58:43.140]  Nico Williams just gave Sporis the opportunity to get on the ball.\n",
      "[58:43.140 --> 58:48.140]  Let's take this thing out of the game and try a few attempts themselves.\n",
      "[59:01.140 --> 59:02.140]  Oh, and...\n",
      "[59:02.140 --> 59:06.140] ...quickly given in his favour.\n",
      "[59:13.140 --> 59:20.140]  This is a view our video assistant referee would have used to conclude matters.\n",
      "[59:24.140 --> 59:25.140]  I want a...\n",
      "[59:25.140 --> 59:31.140]  Johnson's certainly getting involved now and testing his namesake.\n",
      "[59:33.140 --> 59:37.140]  This amazing hobby of the game has now changed to forest-piling for them.\n",
      "[59:37.140 --> 59:43.140]  They weathered that storm, made an extraordinary save, and the belief is starting to come back.\n",
      "[59:43.140 --> 59:55.140]  They're getting on the ball, they're getting on the pitch, they're getting on their team and heavily involved.\n",
      "[59:55.140 --> 01:00:01.140]  Oh, and that's a flying save from Fabianski.\n",
      "[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.140]  Yes, a save he should make, but this is the worry for me.\n",
      "[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.140]  When you're marked zonally and you've got big centre-halves who are able to run into space, attack the ball,\n",
      "[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.140]  they are going to get there, but a bit of the pace is taken off it, so it's a bit of an inflection.\n",
      "[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:19.140]  So, I'm not going to go into too much detail on this, but I'm going to say that there's a lot of things that can be done.\n",
      "[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:25.140]  First of all, they are going to get there, but a bit of the pace is taken off it, so it's a bit of an inflection.\n",
      "[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:31.140]  So, in the first half, as good a goalkeeper as Fabianski is, at that height, he should be keeping it out.\n"

      "[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.140]  Don't try and win the ball back there. It's unnecessary.\n",
      "[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:11.140]  It was a somewhat painful experience as Ben Roy's foot landed.\n",
      "[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:17.140]  I'm not sure if this free kick ends up in the back of Henderson's net.\n",

      "[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:58.140]  Well, it's not his day. A goal chalked off and fractions away from an equaliser there.\n",
      "[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.140]  Just like Fornals, Ben Rama is so unlucky. Dean Henderson is a spectator.\n",
      "[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.140]  He's just hoping things go his way, and they do.\n",
      "[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:14.140]  We break kindly for Forrest. It will, initially. Fornals on the midfield.\n",
      "[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:18.140]  Rico Williams out of the game. And so is Warrall now. Ben Rama raiding.\n",
      "[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:26.140]  And so's it coming in. Well, McKenna with a heroic block.\n",
      "[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:32.140]  Well, one centre-half gets it horribly wrong, and Joe Warrall tries to win the ball, and he shouldn't do.\n",
      "[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:37.140]  That enables Ben Rama to break beyond him here. It goes to ground when he shouldn't have done.\n",
      "[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.140]  McKenna does so, so well getting back. Is there a hand in there?\n",
      "[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:47.140]  I feel that arm is extended out to block the ball.\n",
      "[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:52.140]  McKenna gets away with this. He's a lucky boy, because I do feel that he has deflected that ball away with his arm.\n",
      "[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:58.140]  He knows what he's doing.\n",
      "[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:05.140]  Now we wait, and we wait.\n",
      "[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:13.140]  Well, not heroic, but handled by Scott McKenna.\n",
      "[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:18.140]  Now you see McKenna's moving to his left, and then that right arm, it does just extend out.\n",
      "[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:26.140]  Tries to keep it close to his body, but he's got to extend it to make a connection with the ball, and surely that has to be a penalty.\n",
      "[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:41.140]  They're waiting to see whether it was preceded by an earlier incident that should have been punished.\n",
      "[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.140]  I suppose it's that 4-0 challenge, isn't it? If that's OK, which I presume it is, if they're looking at this, that's OK.\n",
      "[01:05:46.140 --> 01:06:12.140]  It's about whether this is handball or not.\n",
      "[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:29.140]  Well, the question they're asking is whether the goalkeeper's position is going to save him from a red, and it certainly will.\n",
      "[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:44.140]  And Scott McKenna is booked. It could have been worse, but for Dean Henderson's position, it doesn't seem as if there's too many arguments from Scott McKenna and the Forest players.\n",
      "[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:50.140]  That probably tells you they know exactly, he knows exactly what has happened, and it's just instinctive.\n",
      "[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.140]  The arm comes out because the ball is moving towards the goal. He's no idea where Henderson is.\n",
      "[01:06:54.140 --> 01:07:07.140]  He's just looking to block it away and get away with it, but it's pretty clear that's a handball.\n",
      "[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:13.140]  Well, there was a question mark about the 4-0 challenge, which set West Ham in motion.\n",
      "[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:35.140]  Well, the officials are happy they got that right, and Declan Rice accepts the responsibility.\n",
      "[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:44.140]  And in Roxham, because Dean Henderson is able to save, but it's not a lustily hit penalty at all from the West Ham captain.\n",
      "[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:50.140]  It wasn't a great penalty. The first half belongs to Owane, the second half so far belongs to Dean Henderson.\n",
      "[01:07:50.140 --> 01:08:01.140]  Two brilliant saves. I think he really reads this. The way that Declan Rice approaches it, he sees that he's going to wrap his instep around it, knows he's going to go to his right, reads it beautifully.\n",
      "[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:09.140]  He's down quickly. Another stunning save from the forest chimp.\n",
      "[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:16.140]  Henderson's heroism is preserving a clean sheet for Nottingham Forest.\n",
      "[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:23.140]  And then preserving, at the moment, a maiden Premier League victory on their return.\n",
      "[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:30.140]  I suppose when you step up a division, you're looking to sign players. Yes, you need a quality centre forward, but you absolutely need a top-class goalkeeper.\n",
      "[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:34.140]  And in Dean Henderson, Forest have that.\n",
      "[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:39.140]  An opportunity spurned.\n",
      "[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:47.140]  And West Ham about to introduce the two substitutes who've been preparing for some time.\n",
      "[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.140]  The set-piece is settled.\n",
      "[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:57.140]  Nico Williams to play it in. And Wilcate was not expecting it to come to him.\n",
      "[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:01.140]  Surprised in the end.\n",
      "[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:06.140]  If that's a striker, probably the anticipation is there. The expectation that the ball is going to drop at your feet. You took it home.\n",
      "[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:12.140]  But maybe a centre-half? Not very quite as alive. You expect the centre-half to flick it clear.\n",
      "[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:26.140]  It's a wonderful ball in again. Nico Williams, the way, the angle of the ball in was perfect.\n",
      "[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.140]  O'Brien.\n",
      "[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:36.140]  So far, slip. Was it possibly one? Rice is there.\n",
      "[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.140]  Bournaus.\n",
      "[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:47.140]  Benrama.\n",

      "[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:23.140]  They've got a new favourite here at the city ground.\n",
      "[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.140]  Alani, you look at his ability. You can see that. His application as well, with and without the ball.\n",

      "[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:12.140]  That's a wonderfully open game, both sides going at it, Hammer and Tongs are in for a fascinating final 25 minutes or so, but strong play, positive play from Antonio.\n",
      "[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:19.140]  Scott McKenna does ever so well, he stays on his feet, he watches the ball, defensive basics, spot on from the big defender.\n",

      "[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:48.140]  Getting some generous applause from his own followers.\n",
      "[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:58.140]  Just looking at Skamaka's numbers from last season, scored 16 league goals, most of them inside the penalty area, most of them with his right foot.\n",
      "[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:18.140]  Penalty area, a penalty area predator, so for West Ham they have to get that ball into the box, that's where he operates best.\n",
      "[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:30.140]  He has responsibility trying to take off WrestleMania, he's something else.\n",
      "[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:37.140]  It's one thing West Ham really needed to do was just flesh out the squad, bring in more attacking options with some of the players that they've lost in Scamacca.\n",
      "[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:41.140]  He's a big money signing but he was a force last season.\n",
      "[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:48.140]  We'll see how he compares to other strikers in Italian football but as I say he's very much a penalty area striker.\n",
      "[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.140]  So again you don't want him wandering too much.\n",
      "[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.140]  The ball is in wide areas so there's a chance to pick him out in the box, do it.\n",

      "[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:14.140]  The ball was kind of immaterial there, clattering into Scamacca, he's got to watch his step.\n",

      "[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.140]  They have rattled Forest's cage.\n",

      "[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.140]  Pretty much inch perfect free kick from Benorama.\n",
      "[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.140]  You can see he's a spectator there, gets a bit of good fortune.\n",

      "[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.140]  It is a block, it's a great opportunity for Rice but he really telegraphs the penalty.\n",

      "[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.140]  But again I've got to give him a huge amount of credit.\n",
      "[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.140]  He's on his toes, he's aware, gets a bit of good fortune but he's facing the target.\n",
      "[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.140]  When the ball canons off him, he's moving into the box.\n",
      "[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:24.140]  His movement, attacking movement and work off the ball was outstanding.\n",
      "[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:54.140]  O'Brien doing well under pressure.\n",
      "[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.140]  There's Zouma.\n",
      "[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.140]  Dangerous game.\n",

      "[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:35.140]  Certainly finding their way forward under pressure here West Ham.\n",

      "[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:06.140]  Penrahma, who's certainly justified his selection today.\n",
      "[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.140]  Lanzini.\n",
      "[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.140]  Carabone seemed to get a bang inside the penalty area.\n",
      "[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.140]  Soufals, bang into the box was not worthy of further reflection.\n",
      "[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.140]  It's just the wrong choice, he decides to cross it.\n",
      "[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.140]  He's got Penrahma who's come across the pitch offering him a short pass.\n",
      "[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:34.140]  He doesn't take it up, he's so keen on whipping the ball into the box, gets it wrong.\n",
      "[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:39.140]  The hors d'oeuvre for a tasty feast at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea against Tottenham,\n",
      "[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:48.140]  Kupa Raya, Hulibaly and Sterling making their home debuts for Chelsea today.\n",
      "[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:56.140]  Dean Henderson has been fortunate for taking a little too much time in restarting the game.\n",
      "[01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:11.140]  He'll have his place in the headlines.\n",

      "[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:21.140]  He does a lot of selfless running.\n",
      "[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:26.140]  Skahaka's in behind here, Niakate, suckered in.\n",
      "[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:32.140]  Penrahma's on hand, but a goal scorer inside the penalty box is first thought always to shoot.\n",
      "[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:38.140]  Niakate's got a problem here.\n",
      "[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:45.140]  In addition to those that Skamaka might cause him, he is in real difficulty.\n",
      "[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.140]  He's a defender who loves to win the ball and you can't always do that.\n",
      "[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:54.140]  Strikers will use their bodies against you and roll you.\n",
      "[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:59.140]  He's a very aggressive defender, which is great, but you can't always win the ball.\n",
      "[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:03.140]  That's what he wants to do.\n",
      "[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:13.140]  Fabarov, a real experience, is on hand in the shape of Steve Cook.\n",
      "[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:23.140]  It's a good recovery because he gets rolled by Skamaka, but he works hard to get back goalside.\n",
      "[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:33.140]  Steve Cook ready to roll. He wasn't last weekend due to a minor injury.\n",
      "[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:44.140]  He had a much needed steadying presence last season.\n",
      "[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:50.140]  I do recall him having an aberration on a big occasion, conceding a penalty here against Derby last season.\n",
      "[01:19:50.140 --> 01:20:18.140]  That was very much an isolated incident.\n",

      "[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:29.140]  It looks as if Sam Surridge has dropped into the back line to help out.\n",
      "[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.140]  He offers plenty of presence.\n",
      "[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:39.140]  Indeed, at one stage in his youth career, they saw him as a marauding right-back.\n",
      "[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:54.140]  Alan Ekate is back on, but not for long.\n",
      "[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:59.140]  It's admirable that he wants to carry on. Of course he wants to carry on.\n",

      "[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  but that was poor.\n",
      "[34:50.000 --> 35:00.000]  Best side position, the bladder poorly there, sorry.\n",
      "[35:00.000 --> 35:21.000]  Even Bruno Lange having a rueful smile about that miss by Skipper.\n",
      "[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  Not in yet, plaited.\n",
      "[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  It's his first challenge, that's the point he's trying to make,\n",
      "[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  and it is going to be a yellow card for Ruben Neves.\n",
      "[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  Yeah, a little bit of frustration the way he struck that free kick,\n",
      "[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  I think, there, but Paulinho got his body across him pretty cutely there.\n",
      "[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  You can see, look, as it bounces down, he gets his body across him,\n",
      "[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  so he's going to take the challenge.\n",
      "[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  There he goes, look at that.\n",
      "[35:43.000 --> 35:51.000]  And that's maybe a little bit of a harsh yellow card there for me.\n",
      "[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  Portuguese international teammates.\n",
      "[35:56.000 --> 36:07.000]  Swept forward by Harrison Reed.\n",
      "[36:07.000 --> 36:27.000]  Oh, my God.\n",
      "[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  Made a physical by Jarpolinho.\n",
      "[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  He's one of those players, I mean,\n",
      "[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  I even saw it in the first game that he'll get many an interception\n",
      "[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  and goes in for so many little challenges that he's always going to be\n",
      "[36:41.000 --> 36:50.000]  in the thick of it, thinking he may just get a tipping off from the referee there.\n",
      "[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  To be fair, they didn't look a lot wrong with it.\n",
      "[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  Deep.\n",
      "[37:05.000 --> 37:12.000]  Marked in the middle.\n",
      "[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  Defending there from Robinson.\n",
      "[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  He knew Neto was trying to come back on his left-hand side,\n",
      "[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  so he just offered him the chance to cross it.\n",
      "[37:18.000 --> 37:30.000]  So that got a good look in.\n",
      "[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  Punched away by Lerodak, far from convincingly.\n",
      "[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  It's a delightful ball in.\n",
      "[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  Max Kilman.\n",
      "[37:48.000 --> 37:58.000]  The footwork by Max Kilman, who began his footballing career playing foot salve.\n",
      "[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  And a far to side game, which is played with a heavier than standard ball\n",

      "[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  As soon as you turn back on your own goal, you're going nowhere.\n",

      "[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  That way by Dekodova-Reed.\n",

      "[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  Yeah, that was overflow, didn't expect to see Harrison-Reed.\n",
      "[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  Mirovin down that right side, was just trying to get a corner out of it really.\n",
      "[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  Good competitive midfield player, very good in the championship.\n",
      "[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  He's looking forward to his Premier League season and proving himself, I think.\n",
      "[39:21.000 --> 39:37.000]  Very competitive, very tidy in possession.\n",
      "[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  Dubonnetis.\n",

      "[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Pullen.\n",
      "[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Too intricate and there are chances to get the ball up the pitch.\n",
      "[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  Rather like Tete on this near side, there was Cabano on that far side.\n",
      "[40:06.000 --> 40:17.000]  Just turn, clip it down the line.\n",
      "[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  Rodak far from convincing, dealing with Wolves' last in-swinging corner.\n",
      "[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  That one he left to Chosin and the break is on now for Pullen.\n",
      "[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  Cabano.\n",
      "[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  Run back by Gibbs-White.\n",
      "[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  No good to test in there, Cabano, Gibbs-White was stronger than him on that.\n",
      "[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  In that instance, he's got to be stronger, get his body across the opposition there.\n",
      "[40:47.000 --> 41:07.000]  Good chance for a breakaway.\n",
      "[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  Jonny, almost getting in behind Robinson.\n",
      "[41:11.000 --> 41:21.000]  Managed to get back to him, albeit at the expense of a throw-in.\n",
      "[41:21.000 --> 41:27.000]  Marcos Silva would just be a little bit alarmed at the times they got down the sides of Pullen there.\n",
      "[41:27.000 --> 41:49.000]  Both on this near side and the far side, it's a little bit too easy with one ball.\n",
      "[41:49.000 --> 41:58.000]  That's going to be done by Gibbs-White.\n",
      "[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  That comes for him with Cabano.\n",
      "[41:59.000 --> 42:13.000]  Robinson.\n",
      "[42:13.000 --> 42:26.000]  Cabano.\n",
      "[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  This was challenged down by Gibbs-White, he's had a good first half for Wolves.\n",
      "[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Cabano was a bit slow there, Tony, as well, just drag it onto his left foot.\n",
      "[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I know he's right-footed, but just drag it onto your left.\n",
      "[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  There was no chance of him curling it that way to the far post for Mitrovic.\n",
      "[42:41.000 --> 42:50.000]  Just one set to the left and whip it in.\n",
      "[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  Towson.\n",
      "[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's a terrific run by Towson.\n",
      "[42:56.000 --> 43:05.000]  He's run step over too many and he lost out to Ruben Neves.\n",
      "[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  Pedroneta.\n",
      "[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  Pended over by Vico Del Verid.\n",
      "[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  And John Brooks is going across to produce a yellow card for Jean Paulina.\n",
      "[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  Yeah, he knew exactly what he was doing there, because Towson had got caught in possession.\n",
      "[43:23.000 --> 43:28.000]  He made a run up pitch and he committed what you call a tactical foul, I suppose.\n",
      "[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  He stopped the breakaway, but there's going to be plenty of those this season, I think, for Paulina.\n",
      "[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  But he's got to be careful now.\n",
      "[43:35.000 --> 43:41.000]  But there you can see, he knows Towson's up the pitch, a little bit late on it.\n",
      "[43:41.000 --> 44:08.000]  And in the end, there's a foul on this near side in a more dangerous position for Wolves.\n",
      "[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  Pedroneta and Gibbs-White, the two over the free kick.\n",
      "[44:11.000 --> 44:18.000]  Delivered by Pedroneta.\n",
      "[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  Pedroneta again.\n",
      "[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  DiBano got in the way.\n",
      "[44:23.000 --> 44:31.000]  That's a good free kick and a good defending header from Sete, because he's gone back on his own goal and redirected that headed clearance.\n",
      "[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  That was good defending.\n",

      "[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  Bobby did, Cordova Reid thought that he'd beaten Jose Sar, but on the goal line,\n",

      "[01:36:48.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Mitrovic will probably get booked for the yellow card and maybe get another one for that response when Dibswhite came up to him and they were both rubbing their heads into each other.\n",
      "[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Well, just praying that he doesn't respond to this, the referee, and give him a red card here because it could so easily happen. He clatters into Dibswhite as he gets away. He'd probably get a yellow card for that. But will the reaction from Dibswhite and Mitrovic, Mitrovic's back, get him a...\n",

      "[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  He's very, very fortunate. Still being looked at by VAR. But it did certainly appear that Aleksandr Mitrovic leaned his head towards Morgan Dibswhite. They're still having a look at it.\n",
      "[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  And they were both doing it, weren't they? But Mitrovic, neither are pulling away.\n",
      "[01:37:47.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Still being checked for violent conduct. Well, Dibswhite was putting his head in there first and then they were both having a little rub of their heads together. They're lucky boys.\n",
      "[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  That was the yellow card definitely for the foul, but then this afterwards with the two of them.\n",

      "[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  The check to Dover. Everybody can catch their breath and Wolves can take this free kick delivered by Ruben Neves.\n",
      "[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Skip has another opportunity to divert the ball into the full-on penalty area.\n",
      "[01:38:47.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  Mitrovic fortunate? Yes, I think so. And that's an excellent player saying that. He chested in to Morgan Dibswhite. He's gone back at him with a head though. I think they're both fortunate with their reactions.\n",
      "[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Mitrovic having got a yellow card for the challenge before that is probably the more fortunate.\n",

      "[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  Great opportunity for a decent pass there. Kiernan putting free down that left-hand side. Lovely weighted ball. Not the best for crosses.\n",

      "[01:39:43.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  He's got to be careful having just been yellow carded. Grappling with Mbaba and taking a bit of a tumble as well when he didn't need to really. Just needed to defend that ball in the corner, keep it alive, get their crossing.\n",
      "[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  I should have had seven minutes of stoppage time. We're inevitably going to get some additional stoppage time.\n",

      "[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Into the ninth minute now of second half stoppage time. It draws about right, Tony. Better chances for Wolves but full of missing a penalty and a couple of good opportunities from corners as well. Draws about right on the day but still a little bit of time. Don't know how long but down to the referee's interpretation.\n",

      "[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.700]  That's from four, big London derby.\n",
      "[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.700]  And the first Monday night football of the season,\n",
      "[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:34.700]  Liverpool against Crystal Palace from seven.\n",
      "[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:44.700]  Neat flip from Bruno Fernandes.\n",
      "[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.700]  Good energy from Hippie to get back and make the block.\n",
      "[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.700]  But a rare Manchester United corner.\n",
      "[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.700]  And this has been an area where Brentford have been fallible.\n",
      "[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.700]  They conceded the first, Timothy Castagna and Celeste\n",
      "[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.700]  the last week from this situation.\n",
      "[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.700]  So maybe Manchester United can get a bit of joy here.\n",
      "[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.700]  Larrickson standing over it.\n",
      "[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.700]  Bruno Fernandes attacking, but Ben Mee standing firm\n",
      "[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:30.700]  and he was fouled by the Portuguese.\n",
      "[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.700]  You might have seen today's fourth official,\n",
      "[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.700]  Anthony Taylor, pop up when we were talking about\n",
      "[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700]  tomorrow's match at Stamford Bridge.\n",
      "[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.700]  He will be the man in the middle for that one.\n",
      "[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.700]  A little early in the season for another battle of the bridge,\n",
      "[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.700]  but I'm sure it will be feisty.\n",
      "[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.700]  Ronaldo, Rashford the runner, takes it beyond me.\n",
      "[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.700]  And Rashford for Ericsson.\n",
      "[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.700]  Thou shalt not pass, said David Ryer.\n",
      "[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.700]  It was more routine, I think, than he made it look.\n",
      "[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.700]  He just couldn't get the power in it, Christian Eriksson.\n",
      "[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.700]  He does well, Marcus Rashford.\n",
      "[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.700]  You think there's potentially going to be a penalty,\n",
      "[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.700]  but he just doesn't commit himself.\n",
      "[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.700]  The cross is good.\n",
      "[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.700]  I'm thinking that perhaps, as Ronaldo,\n",
      "[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.700]  maybe he could get the power into it, but not Ericsson.\n",
      "[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.700]  Pontiac Janssen needs a little bit of treatment,\n",
      "[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:41.700]  so Stuart Atwell deciding that this will be a good time\n",
      "[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.700]  to have the second-half drinks break.\n",
      "[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.700]  Evening drawing on in West London,\n",
      "[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.700]  but it's still brutally hot for the players down pitch side.\n",
      "[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.700]  Well, if you have just joined us, do not adjust your sets.\n",
      "[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.700]  That is the score.\n",
      "[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.700]  All the four goals for Brentford coming in the first 34 minutes.\n",
      "[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.700]  And this lap, Scarry, from David De Gea,\n",
      "[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.700]  very much setting the tone.\n",
      "[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.700]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:12.700]  Obviously, Manchester United have got absolutely no confidence whatsoever.\n",
      "[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.700]  First goal was going to be important.\n",
      "[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.700]  They lost it through that De Gea mistake,\n",
      "[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.700]  and then St. Brentford mauled them, pressurising them high,\n",
      "[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.700]  outjumping them, outfighting them on set pieces.\n",
      "[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:25.700]  And the last goal was special.\n",
      "[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.700]  Really was.\n",
      "[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.700]  The pass from Toney is brilliant.\n",
      "[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.700]  And then Bermel, that first touch is brilliant,\n",
      "[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.700]  across his body.\n",
      "[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.700]  Wonderful.\n",
      "[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.700]  And captured that first half perfectly for Brentford.\n",
      "[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.700]  The game plan, we can see some of it there\n",
      "[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.700]  on that tactics board from Thomas Frank.\n",
      "[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.700]  He's not taking any chances.\n",
      "[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.700]  Still 25 minutes to go.\n",
      "[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.700]  And they've still got substitutions in the bank as well.\n",
      "[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700]  Just the one change made.\n",
      "[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.700]  He's got two windows to make a subsequent four.\n",
      "[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.700]  He used his changes very well last week.\n",
      "[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.700]  David De Gea electing not to come over to this near side.\n",
      "[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.700]  It's not a bad spot for an evening cocktail, is it?\n",
      "[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.700]  No.\n",
      "[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.700]  They look happier than I am.\n",
      "[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:33.700]  Can I go and join them?\n",
      "[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.700]  I'm just contemplating.\n",
      "[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.700]  I've got Monday night football.\n",
      "[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.700]  With that balloon.\n",
      "[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.700]  I think you've got a long few days ahead of you, Derek.\n",
      "[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.700]  Long week ahead of you with Monday night football, of course,\n",
      "[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.700]  coming up next week.\n",
      "[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.700]  Manchester United against Liverpool.\n",
      "[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.700]  The only decent thing about United at the moment is those fans.\n",
      "[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.700]  And they've had enough.\n",
      "[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.700]  I think they're going to be a bit disappointed.\n",
      "[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.700]  I think they're going to be a bit disappointed.\n",
      "[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.700]  I think they're going to be a bit disappointed.\n",

      "[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.700]  We touched on the immediate concern,\n",

      "[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.700]  some serious business needs to be done.\n",

      "[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.980]  Well, again, I'm at the risk of going back to last season to look at the pattern,\n",
      "[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.220]  but it's four points from the last 24 that Manchester United have taken.\n",
      "[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.820]  I know that effectively they downed Tools at the end of last season under\n",
      "[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.580]  Ralf Rangnick, but they haven't picked them up at the start of this under the new manager.\n",
      "[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:13.540]  No, look, if you want to look for telltale signs of a team that lacks personality and character,\n",
      "[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:18.420]  it's away performances, it's how you do on set pieces, how you fare on set pieces,\n",
      "[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.260]  it's your running stats. Manchester United are miserable in all those areas.\n",
      "[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.500]  Closing in on their seventh successive away defeat,\n",
      "[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:38.820]  have you using that as a barometer of character? It speaks volumes.\n",
      "[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:44.820]  Another optimistic looks at the referee from Anthony Alanga.\n",
      "[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.100]  Manchester United have known for eight to 10 months they needed to rebuild the squad for\n",
      "[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:58.820]  the summer. I think Ralf Rangnick said it was open heart surgery, he described it as.\n",
      "[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.180]  And to not get the players in early, the quality of the players, the number of players\n",
      "[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:14.100]  that Eric ten Haard needed to be able to start the season with is baffling and difficult to forgive.\n",
      "[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.740]  I look at the business that others are doing as well.\n",
      "[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:23.940]  Well, the lack of Champions League football doesn't make it easy to lure some players.\n",
      "[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.660]  But it's not a stall market. The rest of them have performed all the way through the league,\n",
      "[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.140]  teams have got their business done. They might be the odd one.\n",
      "[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.220]  When I come to Alanga, I found Stothford Shims and Jenson Kinklair.\n",
      "[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:49.460]  An example being Brentford, who've gone to Italian football and got Mikael Damsgaard,\n",
      "[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:55.460]  who's had an injury hit season last year after his heroics in the Euros. If you\n",
      "[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.500]  aren't familiar, there he is. He's the player who scored that terrific free kick for Denmark\n",
      "[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.460]  against England in the semifinals of the European Championships. Still only 22.\n",
      "[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.660]  About 17 million they paid for him.\n",
      "[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:12.820]  Every club seems to have a plan. And Manchester United this summer seems to have been whatever\n",
      "[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.820]  targets they were looking for through their own recruitment department. Let's just look at the\n",
      "[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:22.580]  Dutch league or players that have worked under Eric ten Haard. That is not a strategy. You can't\n",
      "[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.700]  do that. That was 15 years ago. You've got to have your own independent recruitment strategy\n",
      "[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.940]  where you've got players identified, the work's been done with the agents, you know who's coming\n",
      "[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.460]  in. And yes, of course, you always try and please the manager and you make sure that if he has got\n",
      "[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.380]  a really good player that he's got good contact with, but the one that he does have good contact\n",
      "[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.060]  with, they can't get in, frankly, the young.\n",
      "[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.540]  Sorry, Gael, I was just going to tell you about the substitutes, which you see there.\n",
      "[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:56.580]  Two of the goal scorers withdrawn Jensen and Bomo and your own with.\n",
      "[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.580]  And Shandon Baptiste, you see that both coming on.\n",
      "[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.140]  Fresh legs to bring fresh threat.\n",
      "[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:17.220]  You know, and we saw the Congolese international second top scorer for Brentford last season\n",
      "[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:22.340]  when they play back for is pretty much a regular on the team sheet and a front three.\n",
      "[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.380]  That may be under threat with the arrival of Damsguard.\n",
      "[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.380]  Rashford working well.\n",
      "[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.300]  Finding Ronaldo.\n",
      "[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:34.740]  Rashford.\n",
      "[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:49.700]  Rashford, he's the way by Ruslav. This is Malasia for Manchester United.\n",
      "[01:18:49.700 --> 01:19:08.660]  Fernando Fernandes, that was well watched and well dealt with by Rico Henry.\n",
      "[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:18.580]  No guard patrolling the near post.\n",
      "[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:24.740]  Up against the Lange and coming off second best.\n",
      "[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:26.180]  Did well there, Anthony Lange.\n",
      "[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:42.660]  Yeah, I did. It was good to show between the two of them.\n",
      "[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.660]  Well, there's a chasm between these two clubs on so many levels, not least\n",
      "[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:58.660]  Fernandes. That's right. Something to think about the cost of the starting 11.\n",
      "[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.460]  Brentford, the most tightly and efficiently run shit. Manchester United, not so much.\n",
      "[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.660]  Yeah, I mean, if you look at that, that's just the start of the 11.\n",
      "[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.700]  It's a real achievement to spend a billion pounds and be this bad.\n",
      "[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:20.660]  Reverse alchemy.\n",
      "[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.660]  Well, I'm sure it'll be looked at Gary, the similarities between the clubs that Manchester\n",
      "[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.220]  United have struggled against at the start of this season, Brighton and Brentford, similar in the way\n",
      "[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:35.540]  they're run, similar in the way they recruit and sell on. Just look at the number of players that\n",
      "[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:44.740]  they have been able to move on to. I can cook a radio, for example, in 15 selling 60 and still they go and win at Manchester United.\n",
      "[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.460]  But Suma likewise, honestly, doesn't take much.\n",
      "[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.100]  And we've been saying this for 12 months going back to the start of last season.\n",
      "[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.940]  It doesn't take much to dismantle this Manchester United team.\n",
      "[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:58.740]  You just need a little bit of organization, a bit of fight, and you're there. Simple as that.\n",
      "[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.900]  Because they fall apart and crumble quite quickly.\n",

      "[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.900]  there's no doubt about that but still Brentford pose problems.\n",
      "[01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:09.860]  He wants the free kick but advantage was played and not taken by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n",
      "[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:25.300]  That's why he's not getting it.\n",

      "[20:43.160 --> 20:48.160]  But the intensity and the pace that Chelsea have come out with, Tottenham have not been able to match.\n",

      "[43:41.880 --> 43:44.880]  He's been completely outplayed in his first half, Tottenham by Chelsea.\n",
      "[43:44.880 --> 43:52.880]  The only positive for Tottenham is, at this moment, it's still only 1-0.\n",

      "[43:58.880 --> 44:04.880]  All the determination of Chelsea, possession, problems with Paul's time.\n",
      "[44:04.880 --> 44:07.880]  One leg's free, but they need to keep it a little bit more.\n",
      "[44:07.880 --> 44:09.880]  They might do now.\n",
      "[44:09.880 --> 44:17.880]  On the verge of half-time.\n",
      "[44:17.880 --> 44:20.880]  Georginio.\n",
      "[44:20.880 --> 44:22.880]  Well, they could have been too.\n",
      "[44:22.880 --> 44:25.880]  And Ruben Lofty-Cheek has the height to reach, though, Paul's.\n",
      "[44:25.880 --> 44:32.880]  Didn't quite catch the drive to get there at the very right moment.\n",
      "[44:32.880 --> 44:34.880]  Georginio is just running this game.\n",
      "[44:34.880 --> 44:36.880]  Tottenham can't get near him.\n",
      "[44:36.880 --> 44:38.880]  Lofty-Cheek at the back post.\n",
      "[44:38.880 --> 44:41.880]  He said he's playing a very narrow position at times.\n",
      "[44:41.880 --> 44:44.880]  Infield, in midfield, he just gets sandwiched.\n",
      "[44:44.880 --> 44:47.880]  And a wide centre-back on the wing-back.\n",
      "[44:47.880 --> 44:52.880]  Doesn't actually get a touch on it in the end.\n",
      "[44:52.880 --> 44:56.880]  He will know the need, the value of a second goal,\n",
      "[44:56.880 --> 45:00.880]  particularly when Chelsea have been on top for so much of this first half.\n",
      "[45:00.880 --> 45:03.880]  It hasn't arrived.\n",
      "[45:03.880 --> 45:05.880]  Also because Tottenham won't play this bad in the second half.\n",
      "[45:05.880 --> 45:07.880]  It just won't happen.\n",
      "[45:07.880 --> 45:08.880]  You just can't see that at all.\n",
      "[45:08.880 --> 45:10.880]  Sure, at some stage, they've got a foothold in the game.\n",
      "[45:10.880 --> 45:16.880]  Ponte's got things to sort out.\n",
      "[45:16.880 --> 45:25.880]  We've got a few minutes, of course, including the water break.\n",
      "[45:25.880 --> 45:37.880]  Here's Christian Romero.\n",
      "[45:37.880 --> 45:46.880]  He's got more than one iron at half-time.\n",
      "[45:46.880 --> 45:57.880]  He has a chance to try and sort this out.\n",
      "[45:57.880 --> 46:10.880]  I think it caused a frustration, just that incident with Sassonior on Loftus-Cheap.\n",
      "[46:10.880 --> 46:16.880]  When they came here for the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final, Jamie,\n",
      "[46:16.880 --> 46:17.880]  he went with a back four.\n",
      "[46:17.880 --> 46:20.880]  That was the first of those three games in 19 days.\n",
      "[46:20.880 --> 46:23.880]  And Antonio Conte took a long time to react to that.\n",
      "[46:23.880 --> 46:25.880]  They were 2-0 down at half-time.\n",
      "[46:25.880 --> 46:28.880]  It finished that way, and he did adjust things in the second half.\n",
      "[46:28.880 --> 46:30.880]  He's certainly got some thinking to do.\n",
      "[46:30.880 --> 46:33.880]  The best news really is that he's not 2-0 down here.\n",
      "[46:33.880 --> 46:35.880]  The big problem is bad centre midfield.\n",
      "[46:35.880 --> 46:39.880]  You see Mason Mount there dragging Eric Dyer right off the centre of that far three.\n",
      "[46:39.880 --> 46:40.880]  That's what they've done all day.\n",
      "[46:40.880 --> 46:43.880]  Mason Mount's position, Ruben Loftus-Cheap's position.\n",
      "[46:43.880 --> 46:47.880]  Coming in as a narrow forward, almost taking it like a box midfield.\n",
      "[46:47.880 --> 46:51.880]  Ponte and Jorginho behind it.\n",
      "[46:51.880 --> 46:54.880]  Those two centre midfield players at the top of their heads are just spinning.\n",
      "[46:54.880 --> 46:58.880]  Not sure whether to close down or look what's in behind them.\n",
      "[46:58.880 --> 47:03.880]  Sarting us back three defender times, just getting dragged into position you don't want to be in.\n",
      "[47:03.880 --> 47:05.880]  That's huge credit, I think.\n",
      "[47:05.880 --> 47:24.880]  Chelsea players, but the Chelsea manager...\n",
      "[47:24.880 --> 47:27.880]  Time's gone by. The players on the field would sort things out.\n",
      "[47:27.880 --> 47:31.880]  I'm sure Graeme Soonhouse might have a word or two in that respect.\n",
      "[47:31.880 --> 47:46.880]  In the half-time interval, the management on the pitch, he was very good at that.\n",
      "[47:46.880 --> 47:49.880]  Welcome fella possession for Spurs.\n",
      "[47:49.880 --> 47:54.880]  In these closing seconds before half-time, can they turn it into something more than that?\n",
      "[47:54.880 --> 48:02.880]  So, Mr. Vijnlofters-Cheap and Mendy does keep it in.\n",
      "[48:02.880 --> 48:06.880]  That's the last act of the first half. Chelsea have dominated.\n",
      "[48:06.880 --> 48:09.880]  Special moments for Khalid Iqbali.\n",
      "[48:09.880 --> 48:13.880]  Storing with one of three shots that he had three out of Chelsea's eight.\n",
      "[48:13.880 --> 48:17.880]  So, he's a centre-back than any player coming to a new club.\n",
      "[48:17.880 --> 48:23.880]  But what is interesting, Jamie, no substitutes at half-time because of the fatigue later on.\n",
      "[48:23.880 --> 48:28.880]  Yesterday, a lot of the substitutions happened late.\n",
      "[48:28.880 --> 48:36.880]  When players were really feeling the heat, maybe Thomas Sukla has no need to make a substitution, of course.\n",
      "[48:36.880 --> 48:40.880]  Or Antonio Conte probably has.\n",
      "[48:40.880 --> 48:45.880]  I must say, I'm surprised there's no changes for Tottenham.\n",
      "[48:45.880 --> 48:49.880]  I expected the two changes.\n",
      "[48:49.880 --> 48:53.880]  Padden just mentioned them in the studio.\n",
      "[48:53.880 --> 48:55.880]  Maybe Perisic at wing-back.\n",
      "[48:55.880 --> 49:01.880]  We saw why Tottenham haven't put the new players in right from the start of the season.\n",
      "[49:01.880 --> 49:06.880]  That's a surprise to me as well because so often last season, Conte was complaining about the squad that he had.\n",
      "[49:06.880 --> 49:08.880]  Good work by Loftus-Cheek.\n",
      "[49:08.880 --> 49:10.880]  In by Havertz.\n",
      "[49:10.880 --> 49:13.880]  And way by Romero.\n",
      "[49:13.880 --> 49:16.880]  Only a bit back where it came from.\n",
      "[49:16.880 --> 49:19.880]  And Havertz.\n",
      "[49:19.880 --> 49:22.880]  It's a case of too many clubs in there for Tottenham.\n",
      "[49:22.880 --> 49:27.880]  It's hardly a Chelsea player in and around the penalty spot.\n",
      "[49:27.880 --> 49:29.880]  Here's James.\n",
      "[49:29.880 --> 49:30.880]  With Borreia.\n",
      "[49:30.880 --> 49:32.880]  Just took the corner they scored from.\n",

      "[49:37.880 --> 49:40.880]  A bit challenged by Emerson Royale.\n",
      "[49:40.880 --> 49:45.880]  I should point out that Stamford Bridge hasn't been a fortress for Chelsea in the last two seasons.\n",
      "[49:45.880 --> 49:48.880]  Just nine league wins here in the 19 games in each campaign.\n",
      "[49:48.880 --> 49:58.880]  They've gathered more away points in those two seasons.\n",

      "[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.840]  game and now it's all kicking off in the dugout.\n",
      "[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.440]  There's previous in that respect.\n",
      "[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:28.760]  Hot weather. Hot centres. Hot spur at level 1-1.\n",
      "[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.320]  Wants to repel and now Jamie Carragher. It's kicking off\n",
      "[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.200]  on the bench. It's kicking off on the pitch.\n",
      "[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:48.920]  I mean this one is going that in sense a lot of people here are wrong.\n",
      "[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.160]  I mean that goes a far. He has to go through his ankle first before he maybe gets a little\n",
      "[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.720]  something on the floor. He wouldn't go that far back.\n",
      "[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.880]  But Martin when you were talking about was it foul I thought you mentioned\n",
      "[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.360]  Georginio on the edge of the box. Yeah that's what I meant.\n",
      "[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.880]  No I mean no you can't go that far back. No of course not.\n",
      "[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.640]  I certainly didn't mean that one.\n",
      "[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.080]  I mean is there something on.\n",
      "[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.320]  I mean\n",
      "[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.280]  I can tell you that has got some\n",
      "[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.920]  torsioning to do. Well I think there's something on with Charleston maybe being\n",
      "[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.360]  an offside position. I think it'd be extremely harsh against Tottenham.\n",
      "[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.120]  I don't think it blocks the goalkeeper's view.\n",
      "[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:48.040]  We'll see. The check is complete. The goal is standing.\n",
      "[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.800]  Some of those in the dugout won't be standing.\n",
      "[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.920]  Maybe it was the celebrations on the touchline that marked the top\n",
      "[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.800]  for the Chelsea bench up. But Thomas Tuker's still talking about that foul.\n",
      "[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:06.760]  Come on Kaj Havertz. Kaj Havertz is doing the same.\n",
      "[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.200]  But even though there's a frustration from Chelsea's point of view that for me\n",
      "[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.760]  that foul's too long and too far away from the goal.\n",
      "[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.520]  I think the first guy may have looked at a foul in the box. Yeah but I'm talking about Chelsea's frustration.\n",
      "[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.000]  Chelsea manager's frustration should come from Georginio. As soon as\n",
      "[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.120]  you start to control the ball and players around them on the edge of the box\n",
      "[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.880]  it's almost too cool for school. It's a London derby. You're in your own box.\n",
      "[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.000]  You see there he's trying to do a drag back and flick it over someone's leg.\n",
      "[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.080]  You don't do that. You just see the position with Charleston. He is offside.\n",
      "[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.440]  But it's whether he's interfering in playing.\n",
      "[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.640]  The ball goes past his foot but it doesn't block the goalkeeper's view.\n",
      "[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.160]  That's a goal. Rightly so. When I keep looking at this man Georginio\n",
      "[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.520]  you don't do drag backs then.\n",
      "[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.440]  I mean he just hits it first time. Almost in. Hold. Almost safe.\n",
      "[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.800]  Muy big. Just takes a little nick. Pula Bali.\n",
      "[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.600]  That is fine. 24 seconds after the foul that\n",
      "[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:22.760]  with involving habits. You know what I mean. It's not even the next phase.\n",
      "[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.920]  I think it was definitely one that could be appreciated about in normal time in\n",
      "[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.280]  the game if you understand.\n",
      "[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.040]  I mean from Anthony Taylor's view you can say that. He gets it just into the ball.\n",
      "[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.480]  But really he has to go through the side of the ankle initially\n",
      "[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.600]  which I felt he did.\n",
      "[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.040]  When he lifts him and the goal goes in. Is that up against the bench?\n",
      "[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.280]  He seemed to be heading in the wrong direction in the end.\n",
      "[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.880]  I mean people said he didn't like scenes like that but I must say I've loved\n",
      "[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.760]  that. I want more of it.\n",
      "[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.040]  Now we've seen Anthony Taylor take some action.\n",
      "[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.000]  And when both managers get booked they are responsible for everybody else in\n",
      "[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.680]  the dugout as well. So it might be antics on the support staff.\n",
      "[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.080]  So if someone does something on the bench it's the coaches who get the\n",
      "[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.120]  other card not them. That has been explained.\n",
      "[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.800]  But if they're sent off it's obviously different.\n",
      "[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.320]  Wait man. One of them is just in jobs now.\n",
      "[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.320]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.720]  What we've said consistently through the game Martin. That man's now come off.\n",
      "[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.640]  I'm sure Thomas took his furious with how he dealt with that situation on the\n",
      "[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.920]  goal. Whether that's the reason or not. But he's been outstanding before that.\n",
      "[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.800]  I mean in the game and maybe that sort of arrogance and\n",
      "[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.760]  confidence because he was playing so well.\n",
      "[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.120]  Made him make that decision. Trying to drag back and flick us all over someone's\n",
      "[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.920]  foot in the box.\n",
      "[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.600]  But no matter how we've said throughout the game Martin. He was still in the game\n",
      "[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.160]  Tottenham. The best thing about this game for them\n",
      "[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.360]  was it was still only one nil.\n",
      "[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.120]  Now they're getting that. Richarlison's played his part\n",
      "[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  in upping the attitude from Tottenham. Defending from the front and forcing the\n",
      "[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.560]  kind of error. Jorginho is a master craftsman. He's\n",
      "[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.880]  been doing running the game really. That's risky to try and run the game in\n",
      "[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.800]  your own penalty area. Just provide a bit of energy for them\n",
      "[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.840]  Richarlison. As soon as he came in he got in behind Chelsea.\n",
      "[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.800]  Off a throw in. Just wound them. He certainly fought\n",
      "[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.160]  Chelsea in a difficult position.\n",
      "[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.640]  But he's progressing from the front. We know he'd provide that as well.\n",
      "[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.000]  Well that's Pellegretto at his own. The top captain who was left out of the starting\n"

      "[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.800]  Well, Spurs are behind it, Stamford Bridge again,\n",
      "[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:26.120]  yet again, Tottenham made changes.\n",

      "[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.320]  two this summer, have been recruited.\n",
      "[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.760]  So with Richarlison, three of them have been brought on.\n",
      "[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.280]  You know, with the changes that he's made,\n",
      "[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.480]  it looks like he's gone back.\n",
      "[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.040]  Maybe through his previous system.\n",
      "[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.960]  See that back five, I'm looking down now.\n",
      "[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.040]  Perisic's gone to wing back.\n",
      "[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.080]  And that back four did get dragged over\n",
      "[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.160]  so far onto one side.\n",
      "[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.160]  Really difficult for Ben Davis, that left back,\n",
      "[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.680]  dealing with two players both.\n",
      "[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.680]  I had a Dan Romero get dragged over so far to one side.\n",

      "[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.680]  That's where the overload came from.\n",

      "[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.240]  Takes the right off, you know.\n",
      "[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  Behind Mason Mount, but he just almost does the goalkeeping with the eyes.\n",

      "[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.240]  Right footed play, trying to find the far corner.\n",
      "[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.240]  And then he does the reset, he's near post.\n",
      "[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240]  All right.\n",
      "[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.240]  All right, all right.\n",
      "[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.240]  And that's Romero, and then they're down.\n",
      "[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.240]  And they're all a bit aggressive.\n",
      "[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.240]  I mean, I think half eights now will not just go on the referees' black book,\n",
      "[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.240]  but it'll be going on Romero's black book.\n",
      "[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.240]  Did we know they were going to make a sequel to Battle of the Bridge 1?\n",
      "[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.240]  Yeah, I mean, I said early on,\n",
      "[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.240]  Martin, I always feel like there's a little bit more need in this game.\n",
      "[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.240]  And now it's been started.\n",
      "[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.240]  The time he does try to check in, and he's got a shot himself.\n",
      "[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.240]  That game finished 2-2, incidentally, I think 2016.\n",
      "[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.240]  Not impossible, is it?\n",
      "[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.240]  They've just completely lost themselves, Martin.\n",
      "[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240]  Since that goal went through,\n",
      "[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.240]  Tottenham's gone really ragged all over the place, with the frustration.\n",
      "[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240]  Chelsea taking that lead again.\n",
      "[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.240]  Chelsea are really dominating now.\n",
      "[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.240]  They're going to go on and get a third.\n",
      "[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.240]  And quite different to the three meetings in January.\n",
      "[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:56.240]  Antonio Ponti's team were hardly in the contests.\n",
      "[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.240]  They've been second best in those stats, as you can see.\n",
      "[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.240]  But getting it back to 1-1,\n",
      "[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.240]  even more looks as though it might be a bit more difficult.\n",
      "[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.240]  And there's a bit of a gap there.\n",
      "[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:19.240]  Even more looks as though it might fall their way off the track.\n",
      "[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.240]  Dio. And it still might.\n",
      "[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.240]  With Lucas Moura.\n",
      "[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.240]  Chelsea played some delightful football in the first half.\n",
      "[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.240]  They really had to battle in the second half.\n",
      "[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.240]  And a long lead.\n",
      "[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.240]  And the rivals, as Jamie alluded to earlier,\n",
      "[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.240]  it's a very strong rivalry, this one.\n",
      "[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.240]  I don't know if it's as close as Marcelo and Tottenham,\n",
      "[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.240]  or indeed Chelsea and Fulham.\n",
      "[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.240]  His first chance he got, he was getting it, wasn't he?\n",
      "[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.240]  Half-hour's on that side.\n",
      "[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.240]  And that's the way to do it.\n",
      "[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:06.240]  I don't have to tell you.\n",
      "[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.240]  Really funny, I think he had something similar with Charles in that season.\n",
      "[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.240]  That was a lot made, obviously, with Charles in the first time\n",
      "[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.240]  he pinned into Jadak on pre-season.\n",
      "[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.240]  Jamie, you keep an eye on those two, and I'll concentrate on the game.\n",
      "[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.240]  Two minutes. First stop of his time.\n",
      "[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:33.240]  It'll be interesting to see how long that is.\n",

      "[03:36.360 --> 03:38.360]  is that even when you are relatively deep,\n",

      "[03:53.360 --> 03:56.360]  And that incredible win over Villa that secured City the title,\n",
      "[03:56.360 --> 03:59.360]  pipping Liverpool to it by a single point.\n",
      "[03:59.360 --> 04:04.360]  And two-nil down, winning 3-2.\n",

      "[04:10.360 --> 04:15.360]  Good no-hand.\n",
      "[04:15.360 --> 04:24.360]  And a goal.\n",
      "[04:24.360 --> 04:25.360]  Walker.\n",
      "[04:25.360 --> 04:26.360]  Great weight on the ball from midfield.\n",

      "[04:40.360 --> 04:41.360]  But maybe because he is that right-back,\n",

      "[04:44.360 --> 04:46.360]  And that occasionally goes on the outside.\n",
      "[04:46.360 --> 04:49.360]  And he just tricks the full-back into a lunging tackle.\n",
      "[04:49.360 --> 04:52.360]  That's not something you want to be doing this early on in the game.\n",

      "[05:16.360 --> 05:18.360]  Had to be sharp.\n",
      "[05:18.360 --> 05:20.360]  He's kept honest by the fact that he actually goes across that near post.\n",
      "[05:20.360 --> 05:24.360]  As a goalkeeper, you've got to wait for any little glance in the header.\n",
      "[05:24.360 --> 05:26.360]  So he has to react reasonably late there.\n",
      "[05:26.360 --> 05:36.360]  And it's a strong right hand to punch it away.\n",

      "[09:39.360 --> 09:40.360]  It's a dream ball for a centre forward.\n",

      "[18:26.360 --> 18:32.360]  Harlan's getting all the congratulations in terms of coming short into that ten area, but it's a trigger there for Gundogan to run in behind.\n",
      "[18:32.360 --> 18:39.360]  Look at him just on the swivel there, one-two round the corner, that physicality to hold up the centre-half and to play that ball into the path of Gundogan.\n",
      "[18:39.360 --> 18:45.360]  Now you look at the composure and we see an abundance. How many times have we seen it from this man? What a goal!\n",

      "[19:05.360 --> 19:19.360]  The one thing people have claimed to with Harlan is maybe his touch isn't good.\n",
      "[19:19.360 --> 19:25.360]  I've seen him for two and a half years in Germany and that touch has got so much better and was excellent. There you go.\n",
      "[19:25.360 --> 19:33.360]  You're quite right. A lot of people have seen him playing in Germany and would have seen that the touch would have been heavy, but he uses his physicality to bump players out of the way.\n",
      "[19:33.360 --> 19:36.360]  Speaking of which, he nearly did that for a goal.\n",
      "[19:36.360 --> 19:42.360]  Travis Gathers, when you have that type of strength, you can do that. You can chase off the touches that are a little bit heavy.\n",
      "[19:42.360 --> 19:50.360]  But look at it here, the quality. This is a point that Damien Delaney was making in the pre-match.\n",
      "[19:50.360 --> 19:55.360]  As a defence, you're going to have to stay deep against him. Look how deep that ball of defence is.\n",
      "[19:55.360 --> 20:01.360]  Yet he still manages to get the ball from deep over the top and gets on the end of it. He should really be finishing that.\n",
      "[20:01.360 --> 20:06.360]  Interesting him looking for that contact from Kelly. He's trying to get that contact.\n",
      "[20:06.360 --> 20:13.360]  I think it's so unnerving in terms of having to play against Harlan in terms of how quickly he moves over the space for such a big man.\n",
      "[20:13.360 --> 20:15.360]  Dundalan, what do you find Spoden?\n",
      "[20:21.360 --> 20:23.360]  Would it be tricky to play against Gary, you think?\n",
      "[20:23.360 --> 20:37.360]  I'm going to be honest, I think he's going to struggle against him, bearing in mind the team around him, the type of ball he'll get in, the quality that he'll receive, and the abundance of chances that he'll have.\n",
      "[20:37.360 --> 20:41.360]  So he'll never go long without having an opportunity. And we've seen the finishing quality.\n",
      "[20:41.360 --> 20:45.360]  Harlan's going to be high numbers this year.\n",
      "[20:45.360 --> 20:50.360]  Two goals, one assist already, and I don't think he's had 90 minutes of Premier League football yet.\n",
      "[20:50.360 --> 20:58.360]  On by Tavenier. Bournemouth look for their own sucker punch in towards Kiefer Moore, good header.\n",

      "[21:15.360 --> 21:26.360]  I think you can see that they expected to win his fair share of those balls in the air because they were surrounding him for any knockdowns, any second balls, and just connection wasn't powerful enough to trouble the keeper.\n",

      "[30:43.360 --> 31:02.360]  Look at the body swerve here as he attacks. Throws a big dummy to his right. It just opens up that space. But you're thinking has he got the ball out to his left foot to take the strike? He doesn't need to. He's an outside right finish. The goalkeeper has absolutely no chance. What a goal.\n",
      "[31:02.360 --> 31:13.360]  Travis couldn't get down in time. De Bruyne used the movement of Harland and bowed him off him. Got him that little bit of space and that is wonderful.\n",

      "[32:08.360 --> 32:23.360]  A little instance of Tavernier that Dornanfield will be looking for in terms of the ball carrying ability he has from Deeds as well and the energy he has. But it's so difficult to complete passes against his Manchester City team.\n",
      "[32:23.360 --> 32:42.360]  I'm not saying that Guardiola is no one to reinvent football, but what he's done in his time in the Premier League is up. He's got Virg and Wenger, Mourinho all done. They're just pioneers in terms of how to gain the ball's prop as well. It's an absolute pleasure to watch his Manchester City team.\n"

      "[39:44.360 --> 39:48.360]  And if you're picking an all-time Premier League team, a lot of those players would feature in it\n",

      "[39:50.360 --> 39:56.360]  But what they're doing as a collective under this manager is absolutely staggering.\n",
      "[39:56.360 --> 40:04.360]  Great running from Tavernier, he's got away from Foden and momentarily from Rodri.\n",

      "[47:16.360 --> 47:28.360]  When Erling Haaland last played here in a Borussia Dortmund shirt, Phil Foden was famously seen whispering in his ear as the pair marched off the pitch.\n",

      "[47:35.360 --> 47:42.360]  Haaland's career has been well orchestrated, hasn't it? In terms of his advice, his family, really good decisions in terms of where he would go.\n",
      "[47:42.360 --> 47:50.360]  Salzburg, then Dortmund. And this is a step up. He is at the top table now in terms of the pressure.\n",

      "[49:10.360 --> 49:16.360]  They'll control the ball like they do anyway. So I just think it's going to be a long second half of Bournemouth, I really do.\n",

      "[49:25.360 --> 49:31.360]  So City have had their major pre-season campaign of seven, eight friendlies.\n",
      "[49:31.360 --> 49:41.360]  Yeah, nice. Quite noticeable, isn't it? A couple of occasions over the last two or three seasons, City come into the beginning of the season slightly undercooked.\n",
      "[49:41.360 --> 49:45.360]  We probably were thinking that with the defeat to Liverpool.\n",
      "[49:45.360 --> 49:52.360]  I think Liverpool are a totally different proposition in terms of how they can hurt City. I don't think many teams in the Premier League will be able to.\n",
      "[49:52.360 --> 50:12.360]  British first touches since coming on for Phil Hoden. Hoden like to Bruno with a goal and assist today.\n",

      "[50:38.360 --> 50:48.360]  That's ridiculous to suggest there's a weakness in his game, but certainly in that Shield game against Liverpool, when City try to play out against him as a right footer and left back,\n",
      "[50:48.360 --> 50:58.360]  it looked a little bit uncomfortable. Listen, we know he could go down the outside and show his quality, but a natural left footer out of this really creates whip for the City team against the very best teams.\n",
      "[50:58.360 --> 51:05.360]  Well, it does seem to be the main thing City fans are calling for in terms of if they're going to do anything else to the window is a left back.\n",
      "[51:05.360 --> 51:14.360]  Shifted out to Christy here. Sergio Gomez arriving from Anderlecht. Surely the left back immediately thought that he was going to be loaned out,\n",
      "[51:14.360 --> 51:26.360]  but it appeared from what Guardiola was saying in his press conference that he will be competing in the first team squad upon arrival.\n",
      "[51:26.360 --> 51:36.360]  That left back position has been the one that they haven't really solved, if they think of Guardiola. Danilo playing out there, Mendy didn't look particularly comfortable there.\n",
      "[51:36.360 --> 51:46.360]  Delph at times as well. Sienchenko is a central midfielder by trade playing more often than not there, but like we just said, the remit of a full-back in a Manchester City,\n",
      "[51:46.360 --> 51:56.360]  or certainly sorry, in a tech Guardiola team is probably how good are you in central midfield.\n",

      "[52:02.360 --> 52:16.360]  OK, heavily linked with the return to Bournemouth club Chelsea in the summer transfer window, but surely only a certain number that City can let out the door.\n",
      "[52:16.360 --> 52:27.360]  They had a reduced buyback clause from Bournemouth initially letting him go, so they didn't activate it then. So it was surprising when he was linked in so soon after joining City.\n",
      "[52:27.360 --> 52:33.360]  I suppose needs must in terms of the fact they lost two key centre-halves in the summer window.\n",
      "[52:33.360 --> 52:40.360]  Absolutely. Chelsea play Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow.\n",

      "[53:14.360 --> 53:21.360]  Can Salo. Oh, great weight on the ball and there's Haaland. Travers improvises and does deal with it.\n",
      "[53:21.360 --> 53:26.360]  Brilliant goalkeeping. He doesn't look particularly clean in terms of clearing it, but he's starting positions excellent.\n",
      "[53:26.360 --> 53:33.360]  Just to close that space. If you think about a penalty to Haaland 1, it's because the goalkeeper was slow off his line for that ball just in behind the centre-halves.\n",
      "[53:33.360 --> 53:39.360]  Not this time, Travers. Excellent goalkeeping.\n",
      "[53:39.360 --> 53:42.360]  Walker.\n",

      "[54:01.360 --> 54:12.360]  It's a good thing to have as a young centre-half. In terms of learning your craft, you've got to learn by yourself at times on the pitch, but having that senior centre-half alongside you, the learning curve can be a lot steeper.\n",
      "[54:12.360 --> 54:18.360]  I was fortunate as a young player having Steve Groose alongside me when he left Manchester United. It's great to have someone like him.\n",
      "[54:18.360 --> 54:27.360]  And obviously, Paul McGraw as well for the Ireland team. Has there been a better centre-half? Certainly not in my eyes.\n",

      "[55:27.360 --> 55:33.360]  Lowney's gone. Players' contracts expired. Gone.\n",
      "[55:33.360 --> 55:40.360]  We've seen it from all three priority teams, haven't we? That desire and at Fulham in particular, that frustration as well from Marco Silva.\n",
      "[55:40.360 --> 55:43.360]  The need to get players in the door for the Premier League.\n",
      "[55:43.360 --> 55:46.360]  Interesting to see Seneci as a centre-half, how he copes in the Premier League.\n",
      "[55:46.360 --> 55:49.360]  Obviously, he impressed a lot of people in the area of Divisi with Feyenoord.\n",
      "[55:49.360 --> 55:53.360]  An Argentinian international as well at 25 years of age.\n",
      "[55:53.360 --> 55:57.360]  Scott Parker said he's an aggressive South American front foot defender.\n",
      "[55:57.360 --> 56:03.360]  I think at times that's not easy to do in the Premier League.\n",
      "[56:03.360 --> 56:05.360]  Brelish. Flag stays down.\n",
      "[56:05.360 --> 56:17.360]  Looked outside on first viewing and indeed the flag does go up against him.\n",
      "[56:17.360 --> 56:22.360]  A lot of the pathway for these Manchester City players really showed their true quality in that second season, didn't they?\n",
      "[56:22.360 --> 56:28.360]  Having worked underneath Pep. I think it's so niche in terms of these tactics, it takes a lot of time to adjust.\n",
      "[56:28.360 --> 56:31.360]  You're just hoping now that Brelish really shows his quality now in his second season.\n",
      "[56:31.360 --> 56:35.360]  It's difficult to be critical bearing in mind he's a Premier League winner in his first season.\n",
      "[56:35.360 --> 56:39.360]  You just feel he's a player of such ability that you really want to influence.\n",
      "[56:39.360 --> 56:45.360]  You said the stats there. The assist, the goal scoring, they have to be higher.\n",
      "[56:45.360 --> 56:53.360]  To that speed. To play for Manchester City, wide areas, as simple as that.\n",
      "[56:53.360 --> 56:56.360]  Likewise with Liverpool, you're dealing with Elisa Mahon, Salah.\n",
      "[56:56.360 --> 56:58.360]  The numbers that these guys are getting.\n",
      "[56:58.360 --> 57:16.360]  Mahrez, who took his time, didn't he, as you mentioned, Gary, to get settled into Pep's way. Pearson, shuffled on to Christie.\n",
      "[57:16.360 --> 57:25.360]  And now Staysen, wants to get on to his right foot. Moore, Tavanier, good football from Bournemouth.\n",
      "[57:25.360 --> 57:30.360]  He's getting away and going a little bit in by Smith, but that should be simple for Edison.\n",
      "[57:30.360 --> 57:36.360]  He's goalkeeping. Tips the ball up early. Knows really he's not going to be challenged by Moore.\n",
      "[57:36.360 --> 57:39.360]  Needs a better delivery when you do get into those wide areas.\n",
      "[57:39.360 --> 57:45.360]  Bearing in mind what a big man he is to attack the ballkeeper Moore at the point of this attack.\n",
      "[57:45.360 --> 57:49.360]  We talk about how hard it is in these conditions for the Bournemouth players.\n",
      "[57:49.360 --> 57:52.360]  A couple of occasions now, that ball's been in a foot race for Kyle Walker.\n",
      "[57:52.360 --> 57:55.360]  He's expecting to go for the burners. He hasn't quite got there, so.\n",

      "[58:14.360 --> 58:20.360]  And side netting. Travis, I think, got a hand to that really good goalkeeping to deny City a fourth.\n",
      "[58:20.360 --> 58:25.360]  Brilliant play. Just slow build up and then the injection is there straight away with a quality little layoff.\n",
      "[58:28.360 --> 58:30.360]  I think Travis has read that situation quite well.\n",
      "[58:30.360 --> 58:33.360]  He's recognised that Harlan's probably not there for the slide across the six yard box.\n",
      "[58:33.360 --> 58:37.360]  So can really protect his near post. Good goalkeeping.\n",

      "[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360]  Then he's surprised that he doesn't work the goalkeeper.\n",
      "[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360]  Julian Alvarez.\n",
      "[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.360]  New Argentina international striker signed from River Plate.\n",
      "[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.360]  Has already scored for the club, as he did in a community shoot against Liverpool.\n",
      "[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  Seems like the kind of scenario in which you'd want to bring him on.\n",
      "[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.360]  So much good work done and industry from these City players.\n",
      "[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]  Good one there.\n",
      "[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.360]  He just never seems strident anywhere.\n",
      "[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.360]  But the ball's knocked up.\n",
      "[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.360]  He's there to pick up the second ball deep to midfield.\n",
      "[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.360]  And very often when they go up the pitch, I know they're quite methodical in their build-up.\n",
      "[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.360]  Give you the opportunity to take your time getting up there.\n",
      "[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.360]  But nevertheless, he's always up there.\n",
      "[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.360]  Here's Cancelo, one of six players from Manchester City on the long list for the Ballon d'Or.\n",
      "[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360]  Cancelo passed Parry and Benzema for the accolade.\n",
      "[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:11.360]  But Foden, De Bruyne, Cancelo, Haaland, Máris and Bernardo Silva all on the list.\n",

      "[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  This would be the big debate in terms of Haaland.\n",
      "[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  He's not the game changer that people like to see.\n",
      "[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  That's Van Dijk, Alisson, who had 20 points to a team.\n",
      "[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]  He can't physically do that.\n",
      "[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.360]  But can he be the difference?\n",
      "[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.360]  You said, will he be the difference in that key moment in Champions League games?\n",
      "[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.360]  Don't let's not forget, City scored five goals in that semi-final defeat to Real Madrid.\n",
      "[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.360]  Five goals over two legs should be enough to go through.\n",
      "[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.360]  Máris, Gündoğan, clips it!\n",
      "[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  And then he clips it inside the post.\n",
      "[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  He had that goal threat really in Emil Kaikoune, who won a couple of seasons back.\n",
      "[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360]  But he started in menacing fashion here.\n",
      "[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.360]  It's the trust all those teammates have.\n",
      "[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.360]  They just find that space, that their teammate will get them the ball.\n",
      "[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360]  On by Diaz.\n",
      "[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.360]  Kirk, Brilis, tries to find Haaland.\n",
      "[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360]  Brilliant ball.\n",
      "[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.360]  And the recovery work from Kelly looked good.\n",
      "[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360]  Haaland's appealing for a penalty.\n",
      "[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.360]  Yeah, you get the benefit of three centre-halves there.\n",
      "[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  That third one in the outside can come.\n",
      "[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.360]  It looks like Haaland was going to bump initially Lerma away from the ball, get his strike.\n",
      "[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  But that third centre-half just comes around on the cover.\n",
      "[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.360]  Does excellent.\n",
      "[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.360]  And then he's got a chance to get a free-kick.\n",

      "[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]  What a ball on the money.\n",
      "[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360]  Giaconcello.\n",

      "[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.360]  He's had every pass and lock in and that incredible outside\n",

      "[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.360]  And a brilliant reception for Bernardo Silva as he goes over\n",

      "[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  Then Phil Foden who came off at half time.\n",
      "[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  Who made that one was then returned the favour by De Bruyne.\n",

      "[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.360]  The case was put forward that it was already damaging for Liverpool\n",

      "[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.360]  We're in the second half, but maybe that won't hurt things.\n",

      "[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]  I think he's all right.\n",
      "[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.360]  Look over to the bench now, whether or not he's going to continue this game.\n",

      "[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.360]  but he was desperate to score on his home debut for Manchester City.\n",

      "[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:38.360]  And his Champions League record is similar to a goal again.\n",

      "[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.360]  and was signed this week from Feyenoord.\n",
      "[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.360]  And he replaces Marcus Tabadier, centre-back for Winger.\n",
      "[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.360]  And I think it will mean that Jefferson Lerma, who scored that own goal,\n",
      "[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:59.360]  will now shift into his more familiar and more suited central midfield role.\n",
      "[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360]  You're coming to a new league.\n",
      "[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.360]  When you're sitting on the bench watching this game unfolding,\n",
      "[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.360]  you're thinking, well, the standard is a huge leap.\n",
      "[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  We're talking about a championship for Premier League.\n",
      "[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360]  But the area of division is way below the level of Premier League.\n",
      "[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360]  With the greatest respect, we've seen our world,\n",
      "[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:22.360]  the likes of IAX, TSV, can compete at times, in Europe especially.\n",
      "[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:29.360]  But this is week in week out. You are challenged.\n",
      "[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  You said four now, didn't you?\n",
      "[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360]  I did, but I'm not overconfident.\n",
      "[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.360]  I said 12 minutes ago that it would remain that sport.\n",
      "[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  We beat Leeds United 7-0 here last season, sitting in the Premier League.\n",
      "[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  During that sport, Marcelo Bielsa's team were just unbelievably open.\n",
      "[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  In terms of how they're defensively set up,\n",
      "[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.360]  and how hard and how diligent Bournemouth have been,\n",
      "[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360]  they're nowhere near them levels.\n",
      "[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360]  And that 7-0 thrashing against Leeds,\n",
      "[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.360]  we've had a totally different way of playing football in the Premier League.\n",
      "[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360]  We're going to be exposed by the very best teams.\n",
      "[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.360]  It'll be easy for Tarpy, even on a 4-0, to say to his team,\n",
      "[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360]  listen, you gave us good shit.\n",
      "[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.360]  We're not going to come across a team as good as City every week.\n",
      "[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.360]  So a chance for Stanislas.\n",
      "[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.360]  A furious key for Moore, just looking for a little slide rule pass.\n",
      "[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.360]  The defenders have come out to Stanislas to close down the initial strike.\n",
      "[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.360]  The pass is on for Moore.\n",
      "[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  Just a little one down the side of Stones,\n",
      "[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.360]  which was a seam of a strike to that right-hand side.\n",
      "[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:37.360]  Well, City have one sub break and one sub left to use.\n",
      "[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360]  And they will turn to the bench here.\n",
      "[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.360]  So important, not only as a defender, but cutting in from right back.\n",
      "[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.360]  Rico Lewis from the Academy joined the club at the age of eight.\n",
      "[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  Just 17 comes on here.\n",
      "[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  What a story that is.\n",
      "[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  Manchester-born, City through and through.\n",
      "[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.360]  Can you imagine how proud his family are and friends watching this now?\n",
      "[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  So it is a well-deserved win for Leeds.\n",
      "[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  And it's a win for Leeds.\n",
      "[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.360]  How proud his family are and friends watching this now.\n",
      "[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.360]  So it is a Manchester City debut to the England U18 international, I should say.\n",
      "[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.360]  Says he's been looking to Joao Cancelo for inspiration.\n",
      "[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.360]  Says how much a right back can get on the ball these days.\n",
      "[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.360]  Well, look, there he is, popping up in that centre midfield position.\n",
      "[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  It's something that we're kind of familiar with now.\n",
      "[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  It was unique at the time when we saw Philippe Lange doing it for Bayern Munich\n",
      "[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.360]  under Pep Guardiola.\n",
      "[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.360]  And that just seems par for the course.\n",
      "[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.360]  It's amazing how much that role has evolved.\n",
      "[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.360]  We're talking about 30 years of the Premier League.\n",
      "[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  And how positions have evolved so much.\n",
      "[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  Centre halves now, you don't see those big strapped in six-foot-five ones\n",
      "[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.360]  who go and commit and win those initial contact, those headers.\n",
      "[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.360]  It's how good they are stepping into midfield, making passes.\n",
      "[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]  How comfortable they are being dragged into wide positions.\n"

      "[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360]  It doesn't seem impossible that Barcelona will find\n",
      "[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360]  another economic lever to pull to...\n",

      "[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.360]  You talk about what's happening with Frankie de Jong\n",

      "[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.360]  they can actually register them to play.\n",
      "[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.360]  Yeah, we're registering players last night, Barcelona,\n",
      "[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.360]  for the weekend.\n",
      "[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:32.360]  I don't think Jules Koundé, the new centre-back from Sevilla,\n",
      "[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.360]  was actually registered for this weekend's game.\n",

      "[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.360]  But he signed Ferran Torres from City in the last few months.\n",
      "[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.360]  And here is Bernardo Silva.\n",
      "[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.360]  He said recently that he misses his home country of Portugal a lot.\n",
      "[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.360]  He'd love to go back and play for his former club.\n",
      "[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.360]  Benfica again.\n",
      "[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.360]  At 27... Oh, no.\n",

      "[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360]  Must be gutted.\n",
      "[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.360]  There's a physical trainer himself\n",

      "[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.360]  So no worries with Cramp or anything for him.\n",
      "[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360]  I suspect, Gary, there won't be anything about the manner of this play\n",

      "[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.360]  the scoreline, that will put doubt in the mind of Scott Parker\n",
      "[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.360]  that switching from 4-3-3 to this new system is the wrong move.\n",
      "[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360]  I'm not looking at this form of performance\n",
      "[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.360]  and thinking you guys are at your depth.\n",
      "[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.360]  We could see Manchester City be 4-0 up\n",
      "[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:52.360]  against literally every team in this league, perhaps, bar Liverpool.\n",
      "[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.360]  So it's no surprise.\n",
      "[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360]  I think he'll look at it and think,\n",
      "[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.360]  happy enough in terms of the distances,\n",
      "[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.360]  the decision-making in terms of when they pressed and when they dropped off,\n",

      "[30:03.360 --> 30:06.360]  I'm precisely, but they don't have that speed.\n",
      "[30:06.360 --> 30:16.360]  I mean, Sarri Glanti, before his injury last season was probably the pace he was playing, gave him the most natural width, if you like.\n",
      "[30:16.360 --> 30:22.360]  Here's another option for later, maybe, on the Brighton bench today.\n",
      "[30:22.360 --> 30:27.360]  That's Levi Colwell, who came the other way from Mark Kukerea on loan from Chelsea.\n",
      "[30:27.360 --> 30:30.360]  This is March, able to bring it under control.\n",

      "[30:33.360 --> 30:39.360]  He's leapt it in towards Wellbeck, who just for a moment lost his bearings a little bit.\n",
      "[30:39.360 --> 30:49.360]  Now with Fabian Schär down, Newcastle get the free-kick.\n",
      "[30:49.360 --> 30:53.360]  Well, it didn't look as if Danny Wellbeck had actually taken the ball, and there were no complaints from him,\n",
      "[30:53.360 --> 30:57.360]  but I mean, Schär, if you put your head down, there's a chance you're going to get kicked.\n",
      "[30:57.360 --> 31:03.360]  It's not conclusive, is it? It certainly comes off the Brighton man.\n",
      "[31:03.360 --> 31:09.360]  You're not going to get a penalty for this.\n",
      "[31:09.360 --> 31:14.360]  Not at any level, I would hope.\n",
      "[31:14.360 --> 31:19.360]  A fairly clear-cut call for Graham Scott in the end, wasn't it?\n",
      "[31:19.360 --> 31:26.360]  So, past the half-hour mark, and this first half of Brighton's first home fixture of the new season.\n",
      "[31:26.360 --> 31:39.360]  They did struggle in front of their own fans here last year, despite ending strongly with successive home wins.\n",

      "[31:48.360 --> 31:55.360]  That was a lovely ball from Dan Burn, wasn't it? Just measured, just flipped over the head of Joel Veltman.\n",
      "[31:55.360 --> 31:59.360]  It teased him into backpedalling, then he decided he wasn't going to get it, then Dunk came across.\n",
      "[31:59.360 --> 32:08.360]  He actually misjudged the bounce, and Wilson nearly got in towards the Brighton goal.\n",

      "[32:15.360 --> 32:21.360]  That's the big summer signing at the back, finally got their man from Lille, having previously pursued him in January.\n",

      "[32:51.360 --> 32:56.360]  March! And surely Ingersoll, it's scrambled away from off the line.\n",
      "[32:56.360 --> 33:00.360]  The referee checks his wrist, and there is no indication that it had fully crossed the line.\n",
      "[33:00.360 --> 33:02.360]  That was Gros.\n",
      "[33:02.360 --> 33:07.360]  I'm sure some of that ball was over, it looked over didn't it from where we are.\n",

      "[33:09.360 --> 33:14.360]  No indication for the referee that that was the case.\n",
      "[33:14.360 --> 33:22.360]  Now Al Maron, blatantly pulled back by Alexis McAllister.\n",
      "[33:22.360 --> 33:27.360]  For which he is understandably going to get the yellow card.\n",
      "[33:27.360 --> 33:30.360]  Well, for me Phil, that is classic Simbin territory.\n",
      "[33:30.360 --> 33:33.360]  I think this is one of the tweaks that we could make in the law.\n",
      "[33:33.360 --> 33:38.360]  As professional and as crude as you like, making no attempt to actually play the football.\n",
      "[33:38.360 --> 33:41.360]  There's the shot.\n",
      "[33:41.360 --> 33:44.360]  Now we thought perhaps it crossed the line.\n",
      "[33:44.360 --> 33:46.360]  Be amazed if some of it isn't.\n",
      "[33:46.360 --> 33:58.360]  It certainly gets beyond Nick Pope.\n",
      "[33:58.360 --> 34:01.360]  We will try and clear that up for you.\n",
      "[34:01.360 --> 34:06.360]  But the technology clearly indicated the whole of the ball wasn't over.\n",
      "[34:06.360 --> 34:09.360]  Sonny March I think must have thought he'd scored when that left his...\n",
      "[34:09.360 --> 34:21.360]  I think it was Trippier wasn't it who scrambled away on the line.\n",
      "[34:21.360 --> 34:37.360]  So Linton made it stick under pressure from McAllister.\n",
      "[34:37.360 --> 34:39.360]  Sam Maxima.\n",

      "[34:54.360 --> 35:00.360]  He was trying to thread that through towards Adam Lallana.\n",

      "[35:11.360 --> 35:17.360]  That's going a bit too much there with Bruno Guimaraes.\n",

      "[35:38.360 --> 35:43.360]  Slowly marched down here but it was he that came so close to opening the scoring.\n",
      "[35:43.360 --> 35:47.360]  Yeah, he's only struck it well and only gets the return ball from Pasal Grosso.\n",
      "[35:47.360 --> 35:50.360]  He doesn't quite have the pace to get on and take a shot on goal himself.\n",
      "[35:50.360 --> 35:51.360]  It's a good hit.\n",
      "[35:51.360 --> 35:54.360]  Dion Dekpoet.\n",
      "[35:54.360 --> 35:58.360]  Yeah, I think quite a lot of that ball is over the line twice.\n",
      "[35:58.360 --> 36:02.360]  Yeah, he just clips it up.\n",
      "[36:02.360 --> 36:06.360]  Then it bounces on the line and partly beyond.\n",

      "[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  It was money that they couldn't turn down for 50 million pounds, probably a so much very good business.\n",
      "[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:32.360]  On the top two, you're going to tell me Phil. I'm not I was waiting for you to do that. Yeah, I know it's more than Torres. He was 50 million to Chelsea wasn't it.\n",
      "[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:45.360]  It may come to us in the next 10 or so to ponder isn't it. Yeah, the next few minutes.\n",

      "[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  Something they're working on certainly working on trying to reach this point and defence here. Sam Metsamon attempting to get in behind.\n",

      "[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.360]  No shortage of targets for him and a very congested penalty area.\n",
      "[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:08.360]  So Linton was his target. Trippier will get a second opportunity here and just as menacingly this time towards Dan Byrne but Newcastle will get the free kick.\n",
      "[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.360]  There's been a flag for offside Dan Byrne. A couple of wicked deliveries in from Kieran Trippier.\n",

      "[01:04:49.360 --> 01:05:03.360]  Trossard has gone down here for Brighton.\n",

      "[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:36.360]  Well that stage of the game isn't it where the changes were almost inevitable.\n",
      "[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:46.360]  Chase on for Callum Wilson. We've had Lewis Duncan as a shadow for much of the afternoon.\n",
      "[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.360]  Trossard found himself outnumbered.\n",
      "[01:05:50.360 --> 01:06:04.360]  This is Almiron. Switches it for Sam Maximot to deliver first time. Well Wilson was his target and it's well defended.\n",
      "[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.360]  Yeah Veltman does exceptionally well. He never loses sight really of where he should be positionally.\n",
      "[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:17.360]  Doesn't really have a lot to see where Wilson is. He focuses on the right area. If it beats the defenders in front of him which it did.\n",
      "[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.360]  And he's had a little bit of luck with such a patient cross. Flies off his shin I believe.\n",
      "[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:27.360]  Oh no maybe more credit than I gave him for. Good clearance.\n",
      "[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:37.360]  We are going to see the change. It will be Adam Lallana that makes way here for Enoch Wepru.\n",
      "[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.360]  And he's had that big chance early in the second half.\n",
      "[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  Denied by Nick Pope.\n",
      "[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.360]  And he makes way for the Zambian.\n",
      "[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:57.360]  Signing Summer Rigo from Salzburg. He comes off the bench for the second game in succession at the start of the season.\n",
      "[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:04.360]  His first job a defensive one taking his position along with everybody else for Brighton in their own penalty area.\n",
      "[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:13.360]  Awaiting his latest delivery from Kieran Trippiatt.\n",
      "[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.360]  Was Dan Byrne who met it but couldn't control it.\n",
      "[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:23.360]  Now what a chance. Missed his time didn't I think Phil?\n",
      "[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:32.360]  Yeah he gets ahead of a mark. He's thinking of his time jump. He's just on his way down. I think yeah he's got to hold that hang never easy.\n",
      "[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:58.360]  Great chance here. He's in position. Serba Webster.\n",
      "[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:11.360]  Turn back doing the day job. Wilson couldn't quite make it stick.\n",
      "[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  Almost came. Winston Casedo did well. Wepru involved early for the first time. Trossard takes over.\n",
      "[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.360]  Delicate stage of the game this.\n",
      "[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:54.360]  We head towards the midway point of the second half. Webster looking for options from the throw. Casedo's intention was to return it to it.\n",
      "[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:13.360]  Will it just get his foot in first? Wepru. Falls for Paschal Gross. He's unselfish. Wilbeck's effort is brought. Joe Linton away frantically but importantly.\n",
      "[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:24.360]  And a Callum Wilson can play the pass here. Here comes the counter for Newcastle. They do have options in support of it. Gimares was looking for Willett.\n",
      "[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:44.360]  Can't get him stretched. Just as a play over plays up all doesn't it Gimares. When it gets sandwiched out and that opportunity is gone.\n",
      "[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:54.360]  Not quite enough pace on that ball was there for a good team mate. He should have got a little stab back from Gross.\n",
      "[01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:04.360]  He just needed a bit more pace on the ball. Not easy at all was it for him to come into.\n",
      "[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:14.360]  As I said, Wilbeck just wanted a bit more on to it and then he's able to really put his foot through the football.\n",
      "[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:20.360]  So another dredge break. Midway point of the second half. Newcastle are readying changes.\n",
      "[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:32.360]  I'm going to see the introduction shortly I think of Sean Longstaff. He's just currently receiving some final instructions.\n",
      "[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:41.360]  Let's talk about the wonderful work that Brighton have done behind the scenes. Tony Bloom the owner. Paul Barber as the chief executive.\n",
      "[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:47.360]  Dan Ashworth now in situ at Newcastle who by the way have appointed a new chief executive of their own.\n",
      "[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.360]  Darren Eales, previously of Atlanta United in MLS is going to start working just over a week's time.\n",
      "[01:10:53.360 --> 01:11:02.360]  He worked with Dan Ashworth previously at West Bromwich Albion and they continue to make appointments behind the scenes.\n",
      "[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:14.360]  Including a new sponsorship partnership manager that they've advertised for trying to increase the revenues that will eventually enable Newcastle to spend the sums that many might have expected initially.\n",
      "[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  Yeah, well those revenues will largely be driven by what happens on the pitch. The team becomes more and more successful and of course more sponsors are attracted to the football club.\n",
      "[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:30.360]  The appeal grows not just in the country and Europe but throughout the world.\n",
      "[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:36.360]  All dependent on what the team of 11 and the squad of players who come in and out of the side can do.\n",

      "[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.360]  He's minded to keep him on. Grose has been a little bit quiet today, as has McAllister.\n",
      "[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  There's time yet for Graham Potter to have a change of heart.\n",
      "[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:09.360]  A little delay in the taking of the corner as well, whilst Graham Scott has words with Wilson.\n",
      "[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:15.360]  So a chance here for Brighton to keep the pressure on. It's cut short for Grose to deliver this time.\n",
      "[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.360]  Clearance a little more convincing, but out only as far as Alexis McAllister.\n",
      "[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  Now Quesedo.\n",
      "[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.360]  Trossard.\n",
      "[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.360]  And he catches with everybody in their own half, back behind the ball.\n",
      "[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  That might change here.\n",
      "[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  Eights and distance on the clearance from Kieran Tripp here.\n",
      "[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.360]  Now I think we will see the raft of substitutions, at least two per team incoming.\n",
      "[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.360]  I'm going to see Longstaff and Jacob Murphy for Newcastle.\n",
      "[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.360]  They've been waiting patiently for a good few minutes, actually, down on the touchline.\n",
      "[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:09.360]  Lamptey and Mitoma will come on, and it is Solly March making way.\n",
      "[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:21.360]  It's a wonderful reception. They are so well-deserved.\n",
      "[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:27.360]  So, Lamptey, equally popular is on in his place.\n",
      "[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.360]  And Trossard making way on the other side.\n",
      "[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:47.360]  It's a double change in the wide positions, and it's welcome to the Premier League for Keoro Mitoma.\n",
      "[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:54.360]  Spent last season on loan. Tony Blim's Belgian side, Union Saint-Gillet.\n",
      "[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.360]  Four goals in seven caps for his country, including the goal that got Japan to the World Cup.\n",
      "[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.360]  He is on here, and now the Newcastle changes.\n",
      "[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.360]  Willett making way, and so too is Sam Maximoff for Murphy and for Longstaff.\n",
      "[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:21.360]  With a quarter of an hour or so for the substitutions to make a difference.\n",
      "[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  So the new three-year contract at the end of last season, Sean Longstaff,\n",
      "[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.360]  and you suspect that injury to Jonjo Shelby will afford him a little more game time\n",
      "[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:36.360]  in the early stages of the new campaign?\n",
      "[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.360]  Yes, one man's misfortune, another one's opportunity.\n",
      "[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.360]  Newcastle players can't claim or won't be able to come the end of the season, you would imagine.\n",
      "[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.360]  They've not had the chance anyhow, has improved them as a group, hasn't he?\n",
      "[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:58.360]  When he took over the back end of last year, last calendar year, at the end of the season.\n",
      "[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.360]  That's what good coaches do, they're able to work with players who may be a little bit\n",
      "[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.360]  disaffected by a previous regime.\n",
      "[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:12.360]  Improve them mentally or, as I said, as a unit.\n",
      "[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:18.360]  There's lots of coaches who can spend 250 million, can't they, if someone else has money?\n",
      "[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.360]  He's going to run away from Lambsea, asking for treatment.\n",
      "[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:29.360]  He tries to have an immediate impact.\n",
      "[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.360]  Yeah, full-back by trade, but such an attacking threat, as I said, Dan Byrne will have\n",
      "[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.360]  different issues to worry about.\n",
      "[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.360]  Here's this great save again, once we'll see it.\n",
      "[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.360]  Nick Pope, yeah.\n",
      "[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.360]  Marks as well to open his body out, it's a good hit.\n",
      "[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360]  More leg, I think, than hand.\n",
      "[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.360]  Either way, it's a great save.\n",
      "[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.360]  Excellent reactions again from Nick Pope.\n",
      "[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.360]  One of the new boys who was in the Burnley team that went down on the final day of last season\n",
      "[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.360]  when beaten out at home by Newcastle United.\n",
      "[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.360]  They got the business done pretty early in signing him this summer.\n",
      "[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.360]  You mentioned the work Eddie Howell has done here, of course, relatively recently.\n",
      "[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:17.360]  He's signed a new long-term contract extension as well, despite only joining in November.\n",
      "[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.360]  In fact, he was here watching on when Graham Jones took charge of the team last November\n",
      "[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.360]  in a one-all draw, and then that's met at the Amex.\n",
      "[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.360]  It had been done just a couple of days prior to that.\n",
      "[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  Didn't take long to have an impact on the team, that is for sure.\n",
      "[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  He's one of those coaches, Eddie Howell, who actually takes some pride and has some confidence\n"

      "[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  Deflection off Dan Byrne, wasn't it? That took it goalward.\n",

      "[01:24:48.360 --> 01:25:02.360]  Yeah, this one's not even close, is it?\n",
      "[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  They must have been checking to see if there was a handball or not with Schur,\n",
      "[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.360]  but he keeps his hand behind his back.\n",
      "[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.360]  Yeah, that's not even close to going over the line.\n",
      "[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:21.360]  Now there was a check that is now complete, but it was another heart-in-mouth moment for Newcastle.\n",

      "[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  And it's not always the best players that make that best XI. He likes to play two up front at home, and that's what he's done today.\n",
      "[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  Coutinho is one of his major signings. He's the one that he wants to turn up because everything creative will go through him.\n",
      "[04:36.000 --> 04:43.000]  So, if you'll bring down the left-hand side from Ramsey, the second one we've seen from him so far in the game.\n",
      "[04:43.000 --> 04:50.000]  Luka Dean against his old side, able to squeeze in the cross. His former teammate, Mason Holgate, there to get the ball away.\n",
      "[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're so important to Aston Villa, aren't they? Dean down the left and Matty Cash down the right.\n",
      "[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  That's where the spaces are. I've just noticed Everton on losses of possession, they're struggling.\n",
      "[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  But twice now, the first time they got a corner from Ramsey's runner, and then they're just struggling on those losses.\n",
      "[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  And they need to be careful and make sure they have the numbers.\n",
      "[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  John, they've been trying to find Luka Dean down that left-hand side.\n",
      "[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  It's the 209th meeting today of the previous 208 matches between the two clubs. Villa lead the head-to-head by only one.\n",
      "[05:22.000 --> 05:45.000]  77 wins to Everton's 76.\n",
      "[05:45.000 --> 05:57.000]  Mason Paterson over there to take the throw in. It has a little bit of a quirky statistic that I think only he could claim.\n",
      "[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  That he played for four different Champions League winners in the space of four months.\n",
      "[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  Steven Gerrard and Giovan Broncos at Rangers, and then Rafa Benitez and Frank Lampard at Everton.\n",
      "[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  I wouldn't have thought there's anybody else in world football who can claim that one, Lucy.\n",
      "[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000]  Superb start, and he is looking bright. We've seen him last week as well, looking bright, getting forward.\n",
      "[06:18.000 --> 06:19.000]  Paterson well advanced.\n",
      "[06:20.000 --> 06:23.000]  Cleared away for Villa by Diego Carlos.\n",
      "[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  There's switched sides today. Tyrone Ming's a left-sided centre-back, so Diego Carlos on the right.\n",
      "[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  There was one thing that Steven Gerrard said when he signed him, that he's happy to play on either side as a central defender,\n",
      "[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  which gives him a fair deal of flexibility.\n",
      "[06:36.000 --> 06:44.000]  Yeah, it obviously looks a lot more balanced now, but it's not just about building up play and the passing angle.\n",
      "[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  It's about when you go out and defend with your proper foot.\n",
      "[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  I know that Tyrone Ming's looked a little bit loose in the inset pieces. He will be there for that.\n",
      "[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Safal by Cash.\n",
      "[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  And Damari Gray.\n",
      "[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Important players for different teams, and Gray on the counter for Everton.\n",
      "[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  He'll have to come to the ball.\n",
      "[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  Recently spilled in the Premier League for eight months, Damari Gray.\n",
      "[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  Frank Lampard made history on this ground. His two goals in May 2013 for Chelsea made him the club's all-time leading scorer,\n"

      "[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  the young player that they signed recently from Lille. Not quite fit enough to be in the starting line-up at the moment for Everton,\n",

      "[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  Chonky picks out a nice ball from McNeil, who quickly tried to turn it on.\n",

      "[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  No, but you know what? He didn't seem bothered, did he? Just dealt with it.\n",
      "[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  People have to be so good with their feet nowadays, and he's one of the better ones.\n",

      "[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  Crossed in by Luka Dean, and the bluff made it comfortable for Jordan Dickford.\n",
      "[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  The big problem there for Jacob Ramsey, there was no-one in the box to cross it too early.\n",
      "[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  And he's made that run into the vulnerable area that Everton have got behind the wing-backs.\n",
      "[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  Yes, they want the wing-backs to go forward, but on losses, they have to get back to the back.\n",

      "[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  It's going to be a physical test as much as anything for the 22 out there at the moment.\n",
      "[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  Yes, it certainly is, and there will be lows within play like there is now.\n",

      "[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  They started the game well, but cannot keep that open.\n",
      "[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  Everton will try and soak pressure and hit on the breaks.\n",
      "[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  It's about choosing your moments.\n",
      "[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Too many options.\n",
      "[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  Too many options there for Matty Cash.\n",
      "[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  So, he's back inside here to one of the new signings, Dhudhikar Kamara.\n",
      "[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  We came from Marseille.\n",
      "[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  So, he's a bit too far in front of Luka Dean.\n",
      "[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  It's interesting when you think about the makers of the Everton squad,\n",
      "[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  because there was a thought last season that they might need a bit more leadership.\n",
      "[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  And Frank Lampard's gone out and signed two Premier League captains on free transfers\n",
      "[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  in James Tarkovsky and Connor Cody, and that's got to be huge for them.\n",

      "[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  Lampard can't do everything.\n",
      "[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  As a manager, you're managing people, and part of that is getting leaders in the dressing room\n",

      "[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  A fancy challenge by Jordan.\n",
      "[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  Whilst we picked up the pieces, Michael Oliver eventually decides there's no advantage.\n",
      "[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  I think it's pretty clear what the areas to improve have to be for these two clubs this season.\n",
      "[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Aston Villa need to win more games here at Villa Park,\n",
      "[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  and Everton need to be better away from home.\n",
      "[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  Yes, I think that Everton will be pleased with the defensive shape from last week.\n",
      "[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  Obviously, until Albert Lewin comes back or they regroup,\n",
      "[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  then scoring goals may be a problem.\n",
      "[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  If you get yourself flying at home, as far as Villa are concerned,\n",
      "[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  then it really gives you a platform.\n",
      "[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  Daniel Ramsey.\n",
      "[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  Anthony Beardley is the only player to play in every match under Frank Lampard\n",
      "[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  since he arrived at Goodison Park.\n",
      "[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  Tyrone Mings, lovely to pick out the ball for Watkins, and Watkins takes it well.\n",
      "[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  Aston Villa with bodies forward here, although Coutinho couldn't quite get the ball under control.\n",
      "[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  It's a really nice pass, though, from back to front by Tyrone Mings.\n",
      "[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  Watkins.\n",
      "[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  On by Kamara, down goes Cash, Michael Oliver.\n",
      "[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  I think he wants to have a word with Matty Cash.\n",
      "[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  The referee's initial decision there was that there was nothing in it.\n",
      "[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  He was holding his shirt, wasn't he, Cash?\n",
      "[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  But he was outside the area, fell into the area.\n",
      "[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  The assistant on this side has got a good view as well.\n",
      "[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  That's the area. Villa are attacking that area.\n",
      "[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  You can see the hand on the shirt there is outside the area.\n",
      "[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  Also has to be a clear and obvious error by the referee.\n",
      "[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  Andy Madley did take a look at it, but has announced the check is over.\n",
      "[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  So nothing doing there.\n",
      "[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  But it's been noticeable early on that both Cash down the right and the left\n",
      "[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  are playing very high up the pitch for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  Yeah, they're targeting Everton in those areas on regains\n",
      "[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  and struggling at times with that.\n",
      "[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  That's a foul by Gordon and Lupe B.\n",
      "[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  A painful one as well for the French international left-back.\n",
      "[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  Anthony Gordon for Everton, just a little bit over the top.\n",
      "[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Just reaching with a challenge on Luka Dean.\n",
      "[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  You can see there, it's more of that left-hand side.\n",
      "[13:10.000 --> 13:30.000]  It's Luka Dean and it's Jacob Ramsey going up and beyond the strikers.\n",
      "[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  Forward by Mason Holgate.\n",
      "[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  That's been rather a lot down that side of Dwight McNeil.\n",
      "[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  Simon Mings across for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  It's difficult for the front three of Everton.\n",
      "[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  No real cohesion because of the lack of focal point.\n",
      "[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  Dynamic, obviously has to come from Gordon in those central areas,\n",
      "[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  but big pressure on him as a young player.\n",
      "[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  Tarkovsky started the opening game of the season with Ben Godfrey\n",
      "[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  and Yerry Mina with him in the back three.\n",
      "[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  Today it's Connor Cody and Mason Holgate.\n",
      "[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  Two players lost on the opening day of the season.\n",
      "[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  It's still a few weeks until we'll see Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n",
      "[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  back in the Everton team as well.\n",
      "[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  We understand.\n",
      "[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  Aston Villa are so narrow, it just allows Holgate to go wider as the right,\n",
      "[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  centre back, and just try and stretch Villa out, get down the side.\n",
      "[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  And it's a bit of a tricky game for Holgate.\n",
      "[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  I think it's going to be tough to get back in the back three,\n",
      "[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  but I think it's a good game.\n",
      "[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  We're going to see a lot of good football.\n",

      "[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  Go and perform.\n",

      "[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  And the space between the lines is really compact\n",
      "[17:30.000 --> 17:51.000]  because of the way Everton have set up.\n",
      "[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  Heading towards the first drinks break here,\n",
      "[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  which is going to be welcome for the players.\n",

      "[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  Given away then by Tarkovsky to Kamara.\n",
      "[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  They've been dominating the ball at the moment,\n",
      "[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  but as Lucy says, they're a difficult team to break down at the moment.\n",
      "[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  Everton, very well organised and lots of players in rigid defensive positions.\n",
      "[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  Watkins, McGinn.\n",
      "[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  Dermot McNeil this time back there helping out.\n",
      "[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  They're giving the ball away, Everton, but they get it back again.\n",

      "[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  As they're waiting, they're saying to the home team,\n",
      "[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  so if you can get passes and then we'll try and work on the counter.\n",
      "[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  Have to be better with passes, though.\n",
      "[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  Kash White fancy taking on Mikhalko here.\n",
      "[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  Rolls it back now to McGinn.\n",
      "[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Luka Dean towards Olly Watkins.\n",

      "[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  He's having to drop it and help out on that side.\n",
      "[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  Sometimes the line is sick to the back when he drops and gets back with Luka Dean.\n",
      "[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  Ramsey to Coutinho and then flicks in towards Ings who's trying to spin.\n",
      "[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  It's just a little nudge there on the back of Mason Holgate,\n",
      "[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  who I think was hoping it came and was waiting for it.\n",
      "[20:10.000 --> 20:13.000]  He got his body in a good position.\n",

      "[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  There was a click of the heels, as well as a hand in the back,\n",
      "[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  but it's an easy foul to give away.\n",
      "[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  Just need to keep the patience, Villa, when they do have the ball in those areas.\n",
      "[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  Robinson have only won one of their last 17 away games in the Premier League.\n",
      "[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  If you flip that round, Aston Villa have won two of their last 12 league matches\n",

      "[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  Off goes McNeil and across came Tyrone Mings\n",
      "[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  just to make sure that Gordon couldn't get onto the ball inside the Aston Villa box.\n",
      "[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  Kind of emphasises just how they've struggled away from home.\n",

      "[21:06.000 --> 21:12.000]  roared on by their tremendous support that ended up keeping them in the Premier League.\n",

      "[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  and it cheered them on, didn't it?\n",
      "[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  To get themselves out of relegation trouble.\n",
      "[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Vitali Mikhelenko.\n",

      "[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Damari Gray needed to be a better ball.\n",
      "[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Gray's done well to keep it in.\n",
      "[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  McNeil and the block made by Diego Carlos,\n",
      "[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  but that could have been so much better for Everton.\n",
      "[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  It was well won.\n",
      "[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  Bodies up the pitch, stole the ball back, and it's a good ball initially,\n",
      "[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  but that ball has to be better from McNeil.\n",
      "[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  It was on side, but it has to be in his path so he can shoot first time.\n"

      "[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  It's a good job that Diego Carlos was where he was, wasn't it,\n",

      "[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  but I think it was Luca Dean might have been playing him on as the ball just got headed back.\n",

      "[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  They've been under pressure for a lot of the probably 25 minutes,\n",
      "[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  but Villa, just those first couple of corners just cause problems.\n",
      "[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  That's the VAR freeze. Suppose that's quite wide in VAR terms.\n",
      "[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  You've seen that the line's a lot narrower than that.\n",
      "[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Yeah, I think you could see that, probably with the naked eye,\n",
      "[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  that Gordon had just gone a little bit forward.\n",
      "[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  You knew he was behind Kash, but it was just Luca Dean.\n",

      "[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  Both of them working out that managing is quite the same as playing.\n",
      "[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  You're not just going to think about yourself,\n",
      "[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  you're going to think about every single person within that squad\n",
      "[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  and how each affects the other and get the best 11 out of it.\n",
      "[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  But certainly, look at some terrific experience.\n",
      "[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  Danny Yates found half a yard to turn.\n",
      "[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  He's got support here from Ollie Watkins.\n",
      "[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Iwobi got a foot in.\n",

      "[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  In the end, it was Tarkovsky who got the boot in to get the ball away.\n",

      "[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  but I think it's the energy sapping out there\n",
      "[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  and they're trying to be a little bit more measured in the build-up.\n",
      "[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  So the Villa captain, John McGinn,\n",
      "[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  out to take the corner in Villa Park, bathed in sunshine today.\n",
      "[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  It's a nice deep one because they thought they might have Coutinho free\n",

      "[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  He stuck to his pass there as well.\n",
      "[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  He just made a stray pass in and had to recover.\n",
      "[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  On by Cash, cleared away by Tarkovsky.\n",
      "[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  Gray gets it to Iwowi.\n",
      "[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  It's a handball, free kick to Everton.\n",
      "[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  And it's a goal.\n",
      "[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  Handball, free kick to Everton.\n",
      "[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  Kamara's header.\n",
      "[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  Watkins tried to get there, but he was beaten to it by Tarkovsky.\n",
      "[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  Here's Decore.\n",
      "[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  Alex Iwowi seems nice and comfortable as a central midfield player,\n",
      "[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  doesn't he, alongside Decore?\n",
      "[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  What a work in there for Everton.\n",
      "[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  McNeil turned straight into John McGinn,\n",
      "[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  who quickly wants to try and release Ollie Watkins.\n",
      "[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  Danny Ings and Coutinho coming in.\n",
      "[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  Watkins pulls it back.\n",
      "[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  Danny Ings took it away from Coutinho,\n",
      "[30:50.000 --> 30:52.000]  but he gets the second stop.\n",
      "[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  Something finished from Danny Ings.\n",
      "[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  And Aston Villa lead Everton by one goal to nil.\n",
      "[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  And Aston Villa lead Everton by one goal to nil.\n",
      "[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  It looked as though the initial chance might have gone,\n",
      "[31:11.000 --> 31:14.000]  but he took the tuck to take it away from Coutinho.\n",
      "[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  But he did not make up with it,\n",
      "[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  with a fantastic left-footed finish.\n",
      "[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  That's brilliant by Villa.\n",
      "[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  First time in a while that they've found Everton out of shape.\n",
      "[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  Everton had committed on his forward.\n",
      "[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  McNeil had lost it in the middle,\n",
      "[31:31.000 --> 31:33.000]  and then that first pass is so important,\n",
      "[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  because that then isolates Tarkovsky.\n",
      "[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  And Watkins did really well.\n",
      "[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  Like you say, Darren,\n",
      "[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  it looked like the attack had just broken down there.\n",
      "[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  Such is a goalscorer of Ings' quality,\n",
      "[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  that he thinks, right,\n",
      "[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  I'm going to make sure this ends up in the back of the net.\n",
      "[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  A superb from Villa.\n",
      "[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  Fantastic finish from Danny Ings.\n",
      "[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  He got seven goals last season.\n",
      "[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  He's now scored against Everton for four different clubs,\n",
      "[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  Burnley, Liverpool, Southampton, and Aston Villa.\n",
      "[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  And it's not that long ago that he scored 22 goals\n",
      "[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  in a Premier League season.\n",
      "[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  He's a fantastic finisher when he's on his game.\n",
      "[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  And he took that quite superbly.\n",
      "[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  And it was going to take something special, I think,\n",
      "[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  to break down this very well-organised\n",
      "[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  and stubborn Everton back line.\n",
      "[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  But that's going to settle one or two nerves here,\n",
      "[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  and maybe just give Aston Villa that little bit more confidence\n",
      "[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  in their attacking play.\n",
      "[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  Yeah, well, Everton had that 5-4-1 shape,\n",
      "[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  difficult to break down, but McNeil loses it centrally,\n",
      "[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  a couple of bodies beyond the ball,\n",
      "[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  and Villa then attacked quickly,\n",
      "[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  and that was the key to that goal.\n",
      "[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  Everton have a problem here with Abdoulaye Ducouré,\n",
      "[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  so I think they might need to make a change.\n",
      "[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  I think Tom Davis is getting himself ready.\n",
      "[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  That kind of tells you the fitness levels of Amadou Onana\n",
      "[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  at the moment.\n",
      "[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  Tom Davis just on his way back as well at the moment.\n",
      "[32:54.000 --> 32:57.000]  But it looks like another injury here for Frank Lampard\n",
      "[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  and Everton when you think they lost Godfrey Amina\n",
      "[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  last week against Chelsea, Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n",
      "[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  in pre-season, and now Ducouré limping off as well.\n",
      "[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  It's been tough for them in terms of players going down injured\n",
      "[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  in the early weeks of the season.\n",
      "[33:10.000 --> 33:13.000]  It certainly is, and they rely on Ducouré and his energy.\n",
      "[33:13.000 --> 33:17.000]  He's been transformed to a box-to-box midfielder.\n",
      "[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  When you do rely on players,\n",
      "[33:20.000 --> 33:22.000]  Onana, obviously, like you say, is not up to match fitness,\n",
      "[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  otherwise he would be the first on.\n",
      "[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  But an opportunity for Davis.\n",
      "[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  Well, let's have a look at the goal again.\n",
      "[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  It was superbly finished by Danny Ings.\n",
      "[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  Yeah, a lot is said about playing these two together,\n",
      "[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  Watkins and Ings, and it looked like the chance had gone,\n",
      "[33:43.000 --> 33:44.000]  but it's that touch wide.\n",
      "[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  It just took three defenders out, and by that stage,\n",
      "[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  Pickford is unsighted, isn't he?\n",
      "[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  And such power gets it in the back of the net.\n",
      "[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  Terrific finish from Ings.\n",
      "[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  First Aston Villa goal of the season,\n",
      "[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  scored by their number nine, Danny Ings.\n",
      "[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  I think, looking at Everton and their shape,\n",
      "[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  when you play a back three and a two in central midfield,\n",
      "[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  you make really good decisions when you lose possession,\n",
      "[34:09.000 --> 34:23.000]  and Everton did really then.\n",
      "[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  So, Tom Davis on for Abdoulaye Ducouré.\n",
      "[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Everton 1-0 down.\n",
      "[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  They're pretty good when they score the first goal in a match.\n",
      "[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  Aston Villa.\n",
      "[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  You see Gerrard's reaction when they scored,\n",
      "[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  and even though it's the second game of the season,\n",
      "[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  he will feel under pressure at a big club like Villa\n",
      "[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  to get them going.\n",
      "[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  He's got the players in he wants.\n",
      "[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  Getting the momentum going again.\n",
      "[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  That's Vitaly Mikhalenko.\n",
      "[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  The flag's down at the moment against Dwight McNeil.\n",
      "[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  And it goes up.\n",
      "[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  I think there are too many people in world football\n",
      "[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  who actually think this is a good idea.\n",
      "[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  No, I think everybody in the stadium has just waited.\n",
      "[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  Just going through the motions.\n",
      "[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  It actually is quite tight, so...\n",
      "[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  I'll take that back.\n",
      "[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  It's actually a really well-timed run.\n",
      "[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  In general.\n",

      "[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  He said it took about five minutes to do the character checks this week.\n",

      "[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  Offended well by Tarkovsky, but Coutinho's got it back again.\n",
      "[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  Tarkovsky was needed once more.\n",

      "[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  and that's not what they want.\n",
      "[36:48.000 --> 36:58.000]  They need to be covered by the two central midfielders in front.\n",
      "[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  Jacob Ramsey supported by Luka Dean.\n",
      "[37:03.000 --> 37:14.000]  Tyrone Minx onto the Brazilian Diego Carlos.\n",

      "[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  But when they do get the ball,\n",

      "[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  they're finding it really difficult to put Aston Villa under any real pressure in open play.\n",

      "[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  and then get the units up the pitch,\n",
      "[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  and they have struggled with that.\n",
      "[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Something they'll try and address.\n",
      "[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  They'll try and bring a striker in if they can find one.\n",
      "[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  Tatterson breaking things up on that side,\n",
      "[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  and now here's McNeil.\n",
      "[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  One back for Villa by Kevara.\n",
      "[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  It's a shrewd bit of business, isn't it, Kevara?\n",
      "[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  Free transfer from Marseille.\n",
      "[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Still only 22.\n",
      "[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Part of the French international set-up as well.\n",
      "[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  Two talented young midfielders in there for Aston Villa\n",
      "[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  and Jacob Ramsey and Boubacar Kamara.\n",
      "[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  He picks up good positions, he drops deep between the two centre-backs,\n",
      "[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  faces the press and passes the ball well.\n",
      "[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  Good start from him.\n",

      "[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  Defended though well by Connor Cody.\n",
      "[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  He then collides with his England team-mates and captain Jordan Pickford.\n",
      "[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  It's probably a bit more nervousness for players who aren't in at the outset,\n",
      "[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  players who want to be in Gareth Southgate's squad.\n",
      "[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  Probably the same feelings for Connor Cody when he was on the bench for Wolves last weekend\n",

      "[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  and then it's straight into the World Cup,\n",
      "[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  so they have to be playing well.\n",
      "[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Whatever you've done in the past,\n",
      "[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  I'd say the one's on the fringes,\n",
      "[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  but Cody wants to play old-fashioned,\n",
      "[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  just wants to come in and get the minutes for the Southerton team.\n",
      "[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  Cody looking long.\n",

      "[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  Just made that run beyond the strikers.\n",

      "[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  He looks around at his bench and is trying to look for something to change it.\n",
      "[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Rondon is the obvious.\n",
      "[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  Just as a target to go into.\n",
      "[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  Because if they haven't got that threat,\n",
      "[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  then Villa will just keep coming on to them and on to them.\n",
      "[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  A foul given away by Alex Iwobi.\n",

      "[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  Such a really clever free kick run.\n",
      "[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  And Iwobi is really alive to it.\n",
      "[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  They've been on the front foot since they've come back out for the second half.\n",

      "[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And behind for an Aston Villa goal kick.\n",
      "[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  Everton have to be encouraged by the joy that they're getting from set pieces\n",
      "[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  and then the second phase after the set piece.\n",
      "[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  It's just that final shot on goal, the final ball in and getting the big lads in the area.\n",
      "[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  Makes you wonder how much success they would have if they had Salomon Rondon up there and played a little bit more direct.\n",
      "[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  I would suspect that that is a change that will be made by Frank Lampard at some point.\n",
      "[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  Probably sooner rather than later.\n",
      "[53:54.000 --> 54:00.000]  But as I say, three wingers up front, it's difficult for them to find that cohesion, getting in the right areas.\n",
      "[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  Coutinho tackled effectively by Cody.\n",
      "[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  Now Alex Iwodi with a bit of space now for Damari Gray, promising again for Everton.\n",
      "[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Gray on the move.\n",
      "[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  It's a good block in there by Cash.\n",
      "[54:14.000 --> 54:22.000]  Cash did well.\n",
      "[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  A tricky customer to Damari Gray in a situation like that.\n",
      "[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  Cody doesn't get the ball away from Watkins.\n",
      "[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  Danny Ince up there with him.\n",
      "[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  Fitting from Davis, Michael Oliver was right there, said he got the ball.\n",
      "[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  And he was in the perfect position there, the referee, Lucy, to make the decision.\n",
      "[54:42.000 --> 54:48.000]  It was a really, really good challenge, I think, from Davis, who did get the ball, but it was a follow-through as well.\n",
      "[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  Gordon takes on Cash.\n",
      "[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  More defending for the Villa right back to Dove, and more good defending by the Polish international.\n",
      "[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  That's better from Everton in terms of how quickly they get the ball up the pitch.\n",
      "[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  You see here, Davis, eyes on the ball.\n",
      "[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  He got to it.\n",
      "[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  Follow-through, it was the follow-through that took Watkins down, but he got the ball.\n",
      "[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  And the referee's right in a good position for that.\n",
      "[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  He's the one, isn't he, that's going to create something for Everton in those channels.\n",
      "[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  Never stops.\n",
      "[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  So another set piece for Stephen Gerrard's Aston Villa to defend.\n",
      "[55:29.000 --> 55:39.000]  James Ampard looking on.\n",
      "[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  Damali Gray then will have another go.\n",
      "[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  Connor Cody on the move in the middle, it's gone all the way through again.\n",
      "[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  It's a chance, and it's a really good block.\n",
      "[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  It was Matty Kats throwing himself at that, Nathan Paterson with the shot.\n",
      "[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  That managed to find a way through, you wonder how much of it Martinez would have seen.\n",
      "[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  Just making a meal of the ball into the box, Villa went.\n",
      "[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  It's about having the attitude to attack it and get the first contact on it that Everton are not making the most of it so far.\n",
      "[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  There's a more open feel to things at the start of this second half.\n",
      "[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  Gray takes on Cash, widens the angle and shoots!\n",
      "[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  And there's the first save today for Martinez.\n",
      "[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  They looked a lot livelier in the final third at the start of this second half, Everton.\n",
      "[56:36.000 --> 56:42.000]  Yeah, there's a better intensity to Everton, they're committing players forward in support of the front three.\n",
      "[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's a great shot by Gray and Cash has done some good defending but couldn't get the block on there and it's just left to Martinez.\n",
      "[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  Straight at him but he still had to deal with it.\n",
      "[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  Zabari Gray's got eight months since his last Premier League goal.\n",
      "[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  He joined Everton from Bayern Leverkusen last summer.\n",
      "[57:07.000 --> 57:14.000]  Very, very tricky when he gets the ball at his feet in a penalty area like that, so difficult for defenders who can't touch him.\n",
      "[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  It's been a good start, though, in the second half, in an attacking sense from Everton.\n",
      "[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  Tyrone makes.\n",
      "[57:47.000 --> 57:48.000]  Jacob Ramsey.\n",
      "[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  Back again from Luka Dean.\n",
      "[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  Anthony Gordon's had to go a long way to track him but Ramsey's given him the slip.\n",
      "[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  And it's defended in there for Everton by Davis.\n",
      "[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  Again, good work by Ramsey, so positive, direct when he gets the ball.\n",
      "[58:05.000 --> 58:14.000]  Probably one player too many to take on, he'd done really well getting past Gordon but then probably needed to release the ball across the box.\n",
      "[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Kamara switching it to Cash.\n",
      "[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  We can have a go at Mikalenko.\n",
      "[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  Now McGinn.\n",
      "[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  And he goes towards Danny Ings and just floated over his head.\n",
      "[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  Good take by Jordan Pickford.\n",
      "[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  Again, little sweet ball into the middle as it comes out to McGinn.\n",
      "[58:37.000 --> 58:43.000]  And you just watch Holgate there, he was aware of Ings' movement and just eased him away, allowed his goalkeeper to collect.\n"

      "[58:43.000 --> 59:06.000]  The last half an hour or so of this game, the heat will take an effect and you've just got to be quite gentle with your build up and make sure you're structured properly and limit those high intensity sprints until you need them.\n",
      "[59:06.000 --> 59:16.000]  That's what both teams have started this game like, this second half like.\n",
      "[59:16.000 --> 59:36.000]  Connor Cody stood on this ground last season in a victory for Wolves when they came from behind.\n",
      "[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  Iwobi.\n",
      "[59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  Tom Davis looking for Nathan Patterson.\n",
      "[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's the right idea, Darren, because the way that the shape that Villa play, the switch is always on, they've not used it often, Everton, but particularly the start of this second half with the wing-backs right at the top of the positions, so that switch is on.\n",
      "[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  You can see that it's been a better second half in terms of possession so far for Everton.\n",
      "[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  David Salas by Watkins, that's one thing you can guarantee from the front two of Aston Villa, they'll work the centre-backs today.\n",
      "[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Will, he's led by the likes of Watkins, making it not a comfortable afternoon for any centre-back.\n",
      "[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  It's one there that's warming up on the sidelines as well, Iwobi's thinking about a change in that second goal will give this team a cushion.\n",
      "[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  It's interesting, yesterday listening to Thomas Tuchel say that the mindset of the players pre-World Cup is going to be interesting because they all know they've got to be committed to their club sides, domestically and in Europe as well, but all of them who think they've got a chance to be at the World Cup want to make sure they're fit too.\n",
      "[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  It's a real conundrum, but you can understand the point that he's making because it's only human nature.\n",
      "[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Yes, because there's no gap at the end of the season before the World Cup comes in now, because it's in the middle of the season, it'll just continue solid football.\n",
      "[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  These players have to be professional, but they will have it in the back of their minds that they want to go to a World Cup and represent their countries.\n",
      "[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Aston Villa will hope it's nothing too serious for Filipe Coutinho, and they're going to bring on a man who can play the same position as him.\n",
      "[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  In fact, he wears the number 10 here at Aston Villa, Emi Buendia, but he plays that position a lot differently to Filipe Coutinho.\n",
      "[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Yes, and he works hard. When you haven't got the ball, he works so hard. It's the same sort of thing when they have it in Villa, they'll expect him to be creative, but Coutinho struggled to get himself into the game this afternoon.\n",
      "[01:02:43.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  So on he comes, it was the club record signing when he came, four goals and six assists in the Premier League last season, and he scored the only goal in the 1-0 win at Goodison Park towards the end of last season to give Aston Villa the victory.\n",
      "[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  So Buendia for Coutinho, that was the first change today for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Aston Villa gets an early touch as well to substitute.\n",
      "[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Here's Kamara, Ramsey.\n",
      "[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Ramsey and McGinn have gone a little bit wider in the second half in that shape, and just now allow Buendia to buzz about as he does.\n",
      "[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Here's Cash, Kamara.\n",
      "[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  There's a little bit of space on that side now for Buendia.\n",
      "[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  John McGinn being urged to shoot, and it strikes the head of Connor Cody, who's slowed down Connor Cody, and immediately Michael Oliver stops the game very sensibly.\n",
      "[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Just to make sure that Connor Cody's OK. I don't know whether it's the initial header or whether he's landed off him, because he's holding his calf as well.\n",
      "[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Yeah, it was a good strike. He had to get his head in the way. He's not going to move from that. Connor Cody, as the ball comes in from McGinn.\n",
      "[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Yeah, straight away he felt that left ankle, I think it was. His left leg, he's only right.\n",
      "[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I think it might be a double issue here for Connor Cody. It was an awkward header for him. It was on the top of his head, but his main concern seemed to be the left calf, didn't it, straight away?\n",
      "[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Yeah, he's just thinking, am I ever going to get away from any injuries? And he definitely won't want it from Cody, who he will want to be playing every game in that position.\n",
      "[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  He's pulling a substitute over straight away, not another one.\n",
      "[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  You can't believe the bad luck that Frank Lampard's having early in the season with key men getting injured.\n",
      "[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  He's called Salomon Rondon back to the bench. He's got to remove the ear jewellery before he comes on.\n",
      "[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Cody won't go. Absolutely no way. See him then, shook his head, absolutely no chance you have to drag him off.\n",
      "[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  However, if he has got a little knot, Darren, you won't want to make that worse and lose him for more games.\n",
      "[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  He must wonder when his luck's going to change. Frank Lampard, Stephen Gerrard, wondering whether his team can hang on and get the first victory of the season.\n",
      "[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  I think it's a testament to the Villa manager that that shirt is still sky blue.\n",
      "[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  On a day like this, it's a testament to his coolness, the fact it's not a darker shade by now, in this heat.\n",
      "[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  So Rondon is going to come on.\n",
      "[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Cody's OK to continue, but it is going to be this attacking change, an orthodox centre-forward coming on now for Everton.\n",
      "[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  We'll see how that can shake things up and alter things in their favour.\n",
      "[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  Danny Ings for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  Wendier.\n",
      "[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Work here for Mikulenko, but he's given the ball away, although the touch from Kamara didn't help.\n",
      "[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  And in the end, it's an Everton throw-in.\n",
      "[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  So Dwight McNeil is making way for Salomon Rondon.\n",
      "[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  A difficult game for Dwight McNeil.\n",
      "[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  He's lost into the box, so not playing that way with a nine.\n",
      "[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  But he's going up, Rondon's coming on, and we're hoping that Demaree Gray and Anthony Gordon get the ball in the middle for him.\n",
      "[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  It's a focal point, didn't score too many last season, three goals in 23 games.\n",
      "[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  He was suspended last week because he got a red card against Brentford towards the back end of last season.\n",
      "[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  But he does change the way now that Everton can play.\n",
      "[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  He'll change the role that Anthony Gordon has out there as well.\n",
      "[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  He's been through the middle, but he'll go and play in a more natural, wider position now.\n",
      "[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Yeah, and get the ball into Rondon, and then they can play off him.\n",
      "[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  That focal point, just take the pressure off.\n",
      "[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Although Everton have started the second half a lot better in terms of their possession and getting bodies up the pitch.\n",
      "[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  It's over there with Tarkovsky, two players with Burnley connections, those two, and that's a power by Danny.\n",
      "[01:07:42.000 --> 01:08:03.840]  Donald\n",
      "[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.840]  Tyrone Minks had a run on Damari Gray.\n",
      "[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.840]  Really doesn't give Damari Gray a chance, that sort of ball.\n",
      "[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.840]  Has to go into the channels away from Minks.\n",
      "[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.840]  Just look at Tyrone Minks, he's not been moving that freely either.\n",
      "[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.840]  Seems to be a problem with the right leg.\n",
      "[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.840]  Let's see whether he can play through that and run it off.\n"

      "[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.840]  Guendier was in there as well and he couldn't quite find enough room to turn.\n",
      "[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:07.840]  He won't be now looking to get it forward towards Salomon Rondon and Diego Carlos gets back there for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840]  The chance though, Lucy, at the other end.\n",
      "[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840]  Yeah, Guendier took it off Ings' foot.\n",
      "[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  He looks lively up front now, Ings.\n",
      "[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]  It's amazing what a goal does for a striker.\n",
      "[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]  It's McGinn and now Cash.\n",
      "[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.840]  Danny Ings takes the ball, he's got it.\n",
      "[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.840]  It was a good challenge in fact by Tarkovsky who stood his ground and read that situation well.\n",
      "[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.840]  It's been noticeable that Guendier's got on the ball a lot more than Coutinho was doing when he was out there.\n",
      "[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.840]  Yeah, you've got to get your own ball.\n",
      "[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.840]  You can't just wait for it and I think Coutinho was, the last parts of the first half was anonymous\n",
      "[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.840]  and Guendier has to come on and prove that he should be starting.\n",
      "[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.840]  I know Coutinho's a big player but it's about who's playing well.\n",
      "[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.840]  Might be a game that suits Guendier a bit more than the man that he came on to refute.\n",
      "[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.840]  It's Gordon midway through this second half.\n",
      "[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.840]  Connor Cody.\n",
      "[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840]  Tarkovsky.\n",
      "[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.840]  Davis out to Mikalenko.\n",
      "[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]  Alex Iwoven.\n",
      "[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.840]  The run was made by Damari Gray and that wasn't that far away from finding him either.\n",
      "[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:26.840]  That's a good ball.\n",
      "[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:32.840]  Maybe the angle was a little bit off but Gray anticipated it was coming through, just couldn't get to it.\n",
      "[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.840]  So hard to defend those deep runs, aren't they, like that?\n",
      "[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:49.840]  Ramsey finds another pocket there for Guendier.\n",
      "[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840]  Ramsey.\n",
      "[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.840]  Now they can be lifted over the top but Tom Davis did well.\n",
      "[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.840]  In fact, he's done well in general since coming on, Tom Davis, particularly defensively.\n",
      "[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.840]  Yeah, combative, isn't he?\n",
      "[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.840]  He got himself in really good areas to just protect that back three a little bit better than what happened in the first half.\n",
      "[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.840]  Well, it's time for drinks in the second half.\n",
      "[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.840]  So refreshment can be taken on board by the respective players.\n",
      "[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.840]  Let's have a look at the Aston Villa goal from Jordan Pickford's perspective because he was past him in a flash.\n",
      "[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.840]  The touch pass, you see he's got three players that's just masking the ball away from his side.\n",
      "[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:47.840]  So he knew where it was going to go, he guessed where it was going to go but couldn't reach far and I think that's what it means to the Aston Villa management team.\n",
      "[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840]  Good finish from Ains.\n",
      "[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.840]  Absolutely no chance whatsoever for the England goalkeeper.\n",
      "[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.840]  Make sure you join us on Tuesday night.\n",
      "[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:09.840]  There's a big night for Rangers, the first leg of their Champions League playoff against PSV Eindhoven.\n",
      "[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.840]  You can see that from 7.15 on BT Sport 1.\n",
      "[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.840]  Ultimate Rangers have got all the way to the Europa League final last season.\n",
      "[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:25.840]  And the UEFA Europa Conference League playoff, which I've said much better in the second half than I did in the first half, West Ham against Vyborg.\n",
      "[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.840]  And that's on Thursday from 7.15 on the same channels.\n",
      "[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.840]  It proves that practice can make perfect, Lucy, doesn't it?\n",
      "[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840]  When you've said it once before.\n",
      "[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840]  Yeah, you're doing well there and you're doing well.\n",
      "[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840]  It's been a sort of a lull, hasn't it?\n",
      "[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.840]  The last 10 minutes, which we expected because of the heat and that'll suit Steven Gerrard's Villa.\n",
      "[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.840]  They've got themselves in front and they just need to be make sure that they're aware of any of the set pieces.\n",
      "[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.840]  And at some point, Everton have to go for it to try and get that equaliser.\n",
      "[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840]  I know that some managers agree with five substitutes.\n",
      "[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840]  Some managers don't.\n",
      "[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:10.840]  But I think on a day like today, you'd be mad if you didn't take up the option to make those changes based on how warm it is.\n",
      "[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840]  For certain clubs, it's such an intense schedule.\n",
      "[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840]  So look until the World Cup, I think 16 matches.\n",
      "[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.840]  If you're a European side, you've got to play those in midweek.\n",
      "[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.840]  There's a midweek batch of Premier League fixtures.\n",
      "[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.840]  There's also an international break as well.\n",
      "[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.840]  So from now until the World Cup, it is pretty relentless for all of them.\n",
      "[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:42.840]  I think they're going to try and make the most of these next two or three weeks where there aren't any midweek requirements apart from the League Cup,\n",
      "[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.840]  where you're going to rest players automatically.\n",
      "[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.840]  But I think from about September the 6th onwards, it just goes absolutely mad for pretty much all of them.\n",
      "[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840]  Tarkovsky in there on Buendia.\n",
      "[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.840]  Danny Ings trying to find a way through.\n",
      "[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840]  And Mason Holgate had to get back.\n",
      "[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.840]  The flag didn't go up because I think it went back up on Everton player.\n",
      "[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.840]  That's why the assistant kept the flag down.\n",
      "[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.840]  The assistant's made some good decisions because as it did come back, it was a head from Tarkovsky.\n",
      "[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  So Ings automatically is in play and he's bright, isn't he, Ings?\n",
      "[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.840]  So corner to Aston Villa at the halt end.\n",
      "[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.840]  And Tyrone Mings has gone in there.\n",
      "[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.840]  Diego Carlos has gone forward as well.\n"

      "[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.840]  He's a vital block in there.\n",
      "[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  Whoever did block it didn't know a great deal about it because it was on them in a flash.\n",
      "[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.840]  Unbelievable, what a strike that was from the centre-back.\n",
      "[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.840]  It's good defending just to get your body in the way from an Everton point of view.\n",
      "[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.840]  I'm going to take a guess at it being Nathan Paterson, but I might be wrong.\n",

      "[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:13.840]  Still plenty of gas left in the tank of John McGinn, but he was slightly overzealous there on the Everton midfielder.\n",
      "[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.840]  They got a little frustrated there. McGinn, as he lost the ball.\n",
      "[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840]  You see the ball come in there.\n",
      "[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.840]  It's a terrific strike, that is. I think you were completely right there.\n",
      "[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.840]  It was Paterson, just stood his ground. That's a sting a bit as well.\n",
      "[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.840]  Pundit Ka Kamara to Emi Dwenfear.\n",
      "[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  17 minutes to go.\n",

      "[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.840]  It's a nice run made by Dwenfear, well found by McGinn.\n",
      "[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.840]  Danny Ng's on the turn, and it's another block by Paterson.\n",
      "[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840]  Here's Luka Dean.\n",
      "[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.840]  He's got a couple to pick out. It's beaten away by the goalkeeper, Dwenfear!\n",
      "[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.840]  And then off the line by Mikalenko.\n",
      "[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.840]  Well, a couple of really good opportunities in there for Aston Villa,\n",
      "[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.840]  and that's a vital clearance by the Ukrainian, Mikalenko.\n",
      "[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.840]  Yeah, Dwenfear's making a difference for Villa since he's come on,\n",
      "[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840]  because he's making those runs forward.\n",
      "[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.840]  He's causing problems for Everton.\n",
      "[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.840]  He had a chance there, but in the end, it's desperate defending,\n",
      "[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.840]  but Everton manage to get it away.\n",
      "[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.840]  Spinning all over the place off Connor Cody,\n",
      "[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.840]  and he had to keep his concentration and get the right contact on that, Mikalenko.\n",
      "[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.840]  Here he is as part of the Everton attack now, flicked on by Rondon,\n",
      "[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840]  away by Luka Dean.\n",
      "[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.840]  Paterson in there sharply on Ramsey.\n",
      "[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.840]  It's worked its way, though, to Ollie Watkins,\n",
      "[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.840]  who's up there on his own to all intents and purposes.\n",
      "[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.840]  Tarkovsky got across for Everton.\n",
      "[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.840]  Ollie Watkins chases.\n",
      "[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.840]  Pickford makes sure he tries to get the top tier\n",
      "[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.840]  so he can give himself some time to get back.\n",
      "[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.840]  It's the multi-ball system this season,\n",
      "[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.840]  so the game's back on the way so quickly.\n",
      "[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.840]  It doesn't matter where he kicks it.\n",
      "[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.840]  It comes straight away for them to take a quick throw in.\n",
      "[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840]  It's good from Pickford, though, good starting position.\n",
      "[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840]  Make sure he's first out to the ball.\n",
      "[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.840]  Here's Ramsey for Aston Villa.\n",

      "[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840]  14 minutes to go.\n",
      "[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.840]  Blendier.\n",
      "[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.840]  Holsen wants Kamara to take a proper goal,\n",
      "[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.840]  but he's gone instead to McGinn.\n",
      "[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  Now to Ramsey.\n",
      "[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.840]  Now to Dean.\n",
      "[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  They've got plenty forward here in Clarendon Blue,\n",
      "[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.840]  but that's not a good enough ball.\n",
      "[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.840]  And these conditions, well, short passes have to be good,\n",
      "[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.840]  but the last few minutes has been all Villa just managing\n",
      "[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.840]  to keep Everton at arm's length in their own half.\n",
      "[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.840]  And I think since Rondon's come on,\n",
      "[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.840]  he's probably only had the ball played into him a couple of times.\n",
      "[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.840]  Danny Ings has just got himself a yellow card.\n",
      "[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840]  He's also got the only goal today.\n",
      "[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.840]  He's the player who's going to come off so that Leon Bailey\n",
      "[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840]  can come on for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840]  What a finish.\n",
      "[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:28.840]  What a way to get your account open.\n",
      "[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.840]  Here's the Premier League this season.\n",
      "[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.840]  What a way to get your first goal of the season for Danny Ings.\n",
      "[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]  I think he's done well.\n",

      "[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.840]  There's Amadou Onana on the right and Dele Alli on the left.\n",
      "[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840]  It looks as though those two are going to be sent on here\n",

      "[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.840]  He sat and watched and noticed that that area,\n",

      "[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.480]  comes out and catches a lot of the time,\n",
      "[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.520]  and I know not a lot of goalkeepers will do that,\n",

      "[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.480]  Got seven and a bit minutes to try and put things right here at Villa Park.\n",
      "[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.480]  Still trailing to that Danny Ings goal in the first half,\n",
      "[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.480]  and the reality is the better chances here in the second half are being forced by the home team.\n",
      "[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.480]  This is going to be a story of games today.\n",
      "[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.480]  There's a lot of breaks, substitutions make a difference,\n",
      "[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.480]  and it just affects the flow of the game,\n",
      "[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.480]  and for Villa it's about keeping concentration for Everton,\n",
      "[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:53.480]  trying to take advantage of these last few minutes and try and get the equaliser.\n",
      "[01:26:53.480 --> 01:27:01.480]  Forward by Kamara, away by Holgate.\n",
      "[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:09.480]  So a right wing-back roll appears now for Alex Iwodi with Nathan Paterson in the back three with\n",
      "[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:24.480]  Holgate and Tarkowski and then Mikulenko on the left with a bit of a shuffle around at the back for Frank Lampard.\n",
      "[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.480]  He's looking for Watkins, Patterson.\n",
      "[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.480]  It's not actually going to be a good idea to go for a left-footed pass,\n",
      "[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:39.480]  but he's looking for Watkins, Patterson.\n",
      "[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.480]  It's not actually gone out, Patterson thought it was going to,\n",
      "[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.480]  and I think everybody else in Villa Park did as well.\n",
      "[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:50.480]  Tom Davis makes the tackle.\n",
      "[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.480]  Banana.\n",
      "[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.480]  Tarkowski on to Mikulenko.\n",
      "[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:19.480]  Here for Villa.\n",
      "[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:27.480]  Ballast in there by Leon Bailey. Here's Buendia, couldn't quite find the pass to Watkins, he's patient. Watkins in now.\n",
      "[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.480]  2-0.\n",
      "[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.480]  Eddie Buendia with a goal that should seal it for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.480]  In front of the halter end, he was patient, the football was slick and sharp,\n",
      "[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.480]  and in the end it was a tap-in to make it 2-0.\n",
      "[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.480]  And he deserves that.\n",
      "[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.480]  Buendia again.\n",
      "[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.480]  He's going to lose the ball in the centre of the pitch.\n",
      "[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.480]  Villa, free game possession, get the ball up there.\n",
      "[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.480]  Great work again by Ollie Watkins.\n",
      "[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.480]  Here's Anani, you can see what he's trying to do, too many bodies around him.\n",
      "[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  Villa with it back.\n",
      "[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.480]  Good passes forward and great movement from Watkins.\n",
      "[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.480]  What's the relationship between him and Buendia?\n",
      "[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.480]  And he's come on and played so well, Buendia, and he deserves that.\n",
      "[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.480]  Ollie just squeezed it in.\n",
      "[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.480]  The club started cheering before it went in and it just sneaked in that far post.\n",
      "[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.480]  He scored against Everton last season, he scored against Everton this season.\n",
      "[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:31.480]  And a two-goal cushion now with four minutes to go will bring the first bit of relief, I think,\n",
      "[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.480]  for the Aston Villa supporters here today.\n",
      "[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.480]  I think the manager knew how important a victory was today as well,\n",
      "[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.480]  because you always want to win your first home game,\n",
      "[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.480]  hence why you see that big smile on the face of Gary McAllister and the rest of the staff.\n",
      "[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:47.480]  And as Lucy quite rightly says, Buendia's come off the bench today\n",
      "[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:51.480]  to replace the injured Felipe Coutinho and been outstanding for them.\n",
      "[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.480]  Well, he started and finished that move and I think that's important.\n",
      "[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.480]  He's affected the game and that's what you want from your subs, so fair play to Gerrard.\n",
      "[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.480]  There's Anana running through, it's an enterprising run by the new man\n",

      "[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.480]  A game that looked like they got in the bag is up for grabs again.\n",

      "[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.480]  Coming in was Patterson to strike one.\n",
      "[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.480]  Now Davis.\n",
      "[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.480]  Nice and calm back there by Kamara.\n",
      "[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.480]  Nice and composed. Didn't smash it, just took it down.\n",
      "[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.480]  And now Davis has a problem with John McGinn breathing down his neck.\n",
      "[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.480]  No foul.\n",
      "[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.480]  Leon Daly.\n",
      "[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.480]  Ollie Watkins can surely seal it now. Big save by Jordan Pickford.\n",
      "[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.480]  It's opened up now.\n",
      "[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.480]  An exciting final few minutes.\n",
      "[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:13.480]  Villa thought they had it in the bag, Everton.\n",
      "[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.480]  Then thrown players forward.\n",
      "[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]  He's played well.\n",
      "[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.480]  Ollie Watkins.\n",
      "[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:22.480]  It would be really good for him if he could cap it off with a goal,\n",
      "[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.480]  but Pickford was out really quick, spread himself.\n",
      "[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.480]  That's a...\n",
      "[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.480]  So Bwende are out to take the corner.\n",
      "[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.480]  Luka Deane.\n",
      "[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.480]  That's a try and drill one across the face of the Everton goal,\n",
      "[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.480]  and only pushed it wide.\n",
      "[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.480]  All about the fourth official now.\n",

      "[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480]  for picking Tyrone Nings today,\n",
      "[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.480]  that challenge there might just have done it.\n",
      "[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.480]  Brilliant.\n",
      "[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.480]  And the corner just before as well,\n",
      "[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.480]  he got his head onto it.\n",
      "[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.480]  Tyrone Nings is just ensuring that he protects\n",
      "[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.480]  any sort of comeback.\n",
      "[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.480]  He knows that Rondon's there.\n",

      "[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.480]  and it's terrific from Nings.\n",
      "[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.480]  And that's what he's all about.\n",
      "[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.480]  He had to come in, and he had to play well.\n",
      "[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.480]  And he just did enough there to protect his keeper.\n",
      "[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.480]  The defenders down there are cramping up.\n",
      "[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.480]  Matty Cash has a problem.\n",
      "[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.480]  He's off the pitch.\n",
      "[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:15.480]  Tyrone Nings needed a stretch after making the challenge as well.\n",
      "[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.480]  It's a day that's taking its toll.\n",
      "[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.480]  It's also a game that's built up to a fantastic climax,\n",
      "[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.480]  and there's five minutes of additional time,\n",
      "[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.480]  so still four minutes to be added on,\n",
      "[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.480]  plus whatever more we get.\n",
      "[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.480]  Esri Konsa and Ashley Young are ready to come on\n",
      "[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.480]  and Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480]  Substitution is usually disruptive,\n",
      "[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.480]  but it actually added to the excitement.\n",
      "[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.480]  The game will continue because Cash is off the pitch,\n",
      "[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.480]  and Steven Gerrard can't make the change.\n",
      "[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.480]  He's furious about it.\n",
      "[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.480]  Here's Buendia.\n",

      "[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.480]  but it's gone straight through to Jordan Pickford.\n",
      "[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.480]  Steven Gerrard's absolutely furious.\n",
      "[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.480]  Matty Cash has had to come back on,\n",
      "[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.480]  despite the fact he can hardly move.\n",
      "[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.480]  Here's Onana.\n",
      "[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.480]  Dele Alli.\n",
      "[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.480]  Nings was there for Villa, cleared away by John McGinn.\n",

      "[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.480]  It's Diego Carlos.\n",
      "[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.480]  They're dropping like flies at the moment.\n",
      "[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:30.480]  It's really taking a toll on the players.\n",
      "[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.480]  Gerrard is not happy.\n",
      "[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.480]  He hasn't been able to make his substitutes.\n",
      "[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.480]  Cash has been off the pitch a while.\n",
      "[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.480]  Fizio's seen to him,\n",

      "[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.480]  Jacob Ramsey has been outstanding today.\n",
      "[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:51.480]  Marty Cash is clearly going to be replaced by Ashley Young.\n",
      "[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.480]  The second change is for Diego Carlos.\n",
      "[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.480]  So they're still waiting to make the final change here.\n",

      "[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:57.480]  Well, it's been a difficult one, but I really, really like the look of young Jacob Ramsey for Aston Villa.\n",
      "[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.480]  I think he makes good decisions on the ball.\n",
      "[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.480]  I think when they've not got possession, he picks up really good positions as well.\n",

      "[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:16.480]  So, man, man of the match is Jacob Ramsey.\n",
      "[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.480]  Thank you, Lucy.\n",

      "[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.480]  But that's taken an awfully long time to make those changes with the treatment.\n",

      "[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.480]  The last touch was a Villa touch.\n",
      "[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.480]  It's a corner, but the club record signing has his head in his hands for Everton.\n",

      "[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.480]  He let it go behind him.\n",
      "[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.480]  Martinez come out.\n",
      "[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.480]  It's all over the place in terms of the players.\n",
      "[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.480]  That many changes gone on have to be organized now for the set piece.\n",
      "[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.480]  So Gordon to take the corner for Everton, who was still in it.\n",
      "[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:30.480]  And that's a good take by Martinez.\n",
      "[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.480]  Been a quite astonishing last 10 minutes for a variety of reasons.\n",
      "[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.480]  It's been really straight.\n",
      "[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.480]  I think the subs just actually add a little bit of jeopardy.\n",
      "[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.480]  I think you can see now Chambers just had to make that challenge.\n",
      "[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480]  He's made a difference since he's come on.\n",
      "[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.480]  You can see the potential in him and why they've paid so much for him, Everton.\n",
      "[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:53.480]  By the way, what a first involvement for a central defender having come off the bench\n",
      "[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.480]  to make a challenge like that at this stage in the game.\n",
      "[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.480]  Callum Chambers.\n",

      "[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:07.480]  Onana reaching it with those long legs of his.\n",
      "[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.480]  And it goes towards Rondon.\n",
      "[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.480]  Ended away by Konza.\n",
      "[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.480]  Back on by Davis.\n",
      "[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.480]  Here's Alex Iwowin.\n",
      "[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.480]  Everton looking for an equalizer.\n",
      "[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.480]  Gordon with the shot.\n",
      "[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.480]  Blocked in there by Chambers.\n",

      "[27:43.180 --> 27:46.180]  When the balls are back in Arsenal, the way they shape up is so different.\n",
      "[27:46.180 --> 27:50.180]  It's clearly something they work on a lot with Mikel Arteta and with Zinchenko.\n",
      "[27:50.180 --> 27:55.180]  Saw him do it for Manchester City, but this narrow position he finds himself in\n",

      "[27:59.180 --> 28:02.180]  Lovely scooped pass from Martinelli.\n",
      "[28:02.180 --> 28:05.180]  Across came Evans and that should be a free-kick.\n",

      "[28:25.180 --> 28:28.180]  Martinelli has been absolutely brilliant for Arsenal.\n",
      "[28:28.180 --> 28:32.180]  That there just epitomises his hunger to want to win the ball back\n",
      "[28:32.180 --> 28:35.180]  and how physical he's been for an attacking player.\n",
      "[28:35.180 --> 28:38.180]  He's really put that man on the back foot.\n",
      "[28:38.180 --> 28:42.180]  A tough start for Fofana after he almost scored.\n",
      "[28:42.180 --> 28:47.180]  Opening few minutes, but all round a bit ragged by Martinelli since then.\n",

      "[29:36.180 --> 29:39.180]  Xhaka right behind him.\n",

      "[34:29.180 --> 34:32.180]  It's barely played left-back in this game, Zinchenko.\n",
      "[34:32.180 --> 34:36.180]  It's made midfield, isn't it? Half the time, just tucked in that midfield position.\n",

      "[34:42.180 --> 34:50.180]  Up to the near post. Arsenal's new number nine is settling in just fine.\n",

      "[35:28.180 --> 35:32.180]  Anyone will tell you goals are scored in that area of the pitch.\n",
      "[35:32.180 --> 35:37.180]  He knows that. His teammates are causing havoc all over from the set-piece.\n",

      "[35:40.180 --> 35:44.180]  They switch off at the back post. I think it's Indeedee or Marti who's the wrong side.\n",
      "[35:44.180 --> 35:48.180]  And that little area there, just for that lovely little header tap-in,\n",
      "[35:48.180 --> 35:54.180]  is exactly where poacher goal-scorers are, and he is looking more and more like one of those by the minute.\n",
      "[35:54.180 --> 36:00.180]  Well, for Gabriel Jesus, what a first half for him.\n",
      "[36:01.180 --> 36:08.180]  But you're almost unsurprised, because we know his quality in the Premier League,\n",
      "[36:08.180 --> 36:13.180]  and that's why Arsenal wanted him here, and he's the main man here at the Emirates.\n",

      "[36:33.180 --> 36:38.180]  Now Justin, can he still in behind? White just got a touch on that.\n",

      "[36:57.180 --> 37:00.180]  I think it's a touch from Indeedee, isn't it? It just puts him off.\n",
      "[37:00.180 --> 37:03.180]  I mean, how well does he use his body here? Gabriel Jesus,\n",
      "[37:03.180 --> 37:08.180]  Evans doesn't handle this well at all. He drops far too deep.\n",

      "[57:55.180 --> 57:58.180]  It's just a shame he can't get a little bit more angle on that header.\n",
      "[57:58.180 --> 58:02.180]  Just to be able to head it wider that post and out for a corner.\n",
      "[58:02.180 --> 58:06.180]  But, you know, just shows you how quickly the game can turn.\n",
      "[58:06.180 --> 58:08.180]  And Leicester right back in this now.\n",
      "[58:08.180 --> 58:11.180]  Yes, Leicester certainly needed that right at the start of the second half.\n",
      "[58:11.180 --> 58:14.180]  And a game which had a very encouraging start.\n",
      "[58:14.180 --> 58:17.180]  And that both sides were looking dangerous.\n",

      "[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:45.180]  Just after such a high-quality first half, we kind of start the second half with almost a little bit of a couple of shambolic errors, really.\n",
      "[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:51.180]  It shows you how quickly the game can turn and how two halves of football can be very different.\n",
      "[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.180]  And Arsenal on the attack again. Jesus goes down.\n",

      "[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:10.180]  They're having a look at the moment, the challenge on Jesus.\n",
      "[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.180]  Certainly a leg dangled out by Amartey, wasn't there?\n",
      "[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:19.180]  Whether or not, similar to the Vardy one, there's enough contact.\n",
      "[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.180]  Well, the check is complete. No penalty.\n",
      "[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:31.180]  It's always tempting as a defender. You get sidestepped like that.\n",
      "[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.180]  You just dangle your leg through and he does lift that leg as well.\n",
      "[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.180]  Amartey lifts it up into Jesus.\n",
      "[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:45.180]  I think Leicester believe that Fafana may have been fouled in the build-up by Xhaka.\n",
      "[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:51.180]  But either way, shaking the head from Jesus, you know he would have stepped up to take that penalty.\n",
      "[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:55.180]  Yeah, you can only think the VAR looked at it and thought there wasn't enough contact.\n",

      "[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.180]  There has to be sufficient contact for a player to go down.\n",
      "[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.180]  And I think Jesus is looking for that train of leg.\n",
      "[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.180]  And that's the difference in centre forward play.\n",
      "[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.180]  You've seen it in two instances in this game.\n",
      "[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.180]  Vardy looking to draw that contact. Good centre forward play.\n",
      "[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.180]  Wait for the keeper to touch you and you go down.\n",
      "[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.180]  But now with VAR, all of those kind of contacts are being reviewed in real time.\n",
      "[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.180]  That looked like a penalty. You slow it down and it doesn't.\n",
      "[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.180]  And I was really interested in how it does affect centre forwards and how they want to play the game.\n",
      "[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.180]  Yeah, key point laid out at the start of this season.\n",
      "[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:45.180]  But as Matthew said there, just because there's contact doesn't mean it's a foul and a penalty is going to be awarded.\n",

      "[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.180]  Quite the start to this second half.\n",
      "[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.180]  And a very eventful game as well.\n",
      "[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:00.180]  Throw in to Leicester.\n",
      "[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:08.180]  When you just love games like this where you feel like at any moment anything can happen, either side could score.\n",

      "[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.180]  Castagna. Good foot there from Leicester.\n",

      "[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.180]  Who has had some standout moments for Leicester in his time with them.\n",
      "[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:45.180]  And better of course than that winning goal in the FA Cup final.\n",

      "[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:01.180]  Maddison to take this corner for Leicester City. It's a decent delivery.\n",

      "[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:13.180]  Maddison wants the ball again. Zinchenko of course.\n",
      "[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:34.180]  And the crowd enjoying his defensive moments in particular.\n",

      "[01:04:45.180 --> 01:05:07.180]  Justin so frustrating for the away side.\n",
      "[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.180]  Fafana. And Castagna.\n",
      "[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:14.180]  Going back and wards.\n",
      "[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.180]  Calmly done in the end.\n",
      "[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.180]  A calm moment for him.\n",
      "[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:24.180]  What a back pass. Castagna just fired that ward.\n",
      "[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:29.180]  Bit of height and bounce on the ball as well. Really had to have a very sure first touch.\n",
      "[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.180]  Probably not what he wanted after that last mistake.\n",
      "[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:42.180]  Here's Jakka.\n",
      "[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:46.180]  And party out to Oerdegaard.\n",
      "[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.180]  And Saka offside. That combination between Saka and Oerdegaard.\n",
      "[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:56.180]  A little bit quieter on that right-hand side but shouldn't bother Arsenal too much.\n",
      "[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:14.180]  The left's been pretty good.\n",
      "[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:29.180]  Here's Saliba.\n",
      "[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.180]  Well Leicester are going to make a double change very shortly. It looks like\n",
      "[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.180]  Hassan Dakar and Dennis Pratt down there.\n",
      "[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.180]  Arsenal on the attack.\n",
      "[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.180]  Martinelli.\n",
      "[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:49.180]  Got away from Thielemans. Martinelli needed three Leicester players in the end to try and stop him and he still has it.\n",

      "[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.180]  And he spotted a gap. And Jakka.\n",
      "[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:59.180]  And that's going to be a goal kick in the end. But Granit Xhaka scoring that goal for Arsenal.\n",

      "[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.180]  But under a minute from the restart as well.\n",
      "[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:17.180]  So the double change made and Uri Thielemans' match comes to an end.\n",

      "[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:25.180]  Into that midfield and it's a Marti coming off for Dakar.\n",
      "[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.180]  So a change in shape here from Leicester and Dakar came on against Brentford\n",
      "[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:36.180]  for a midfield player that time in Dewsbury Hall and they changed shape then and things went a bit sour after that.\n",
      "[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:40.180]  But Rodgers knows he needs to change things here. He needs to change things.\n",
      "[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.180]  You know, it's a bit of a roll of the dice for Brenda Rodgers bringing on Dakar.\n",
      "[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:52.180]  But Thielemans is probably not the game he was hoping to have against Arsenal at this moment in time with the interest that's there.\n",
      "[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:57.180]  It's one of those matches that you really want to try and shine in. He hasn't been able to do that today.\n",

      "[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:04.180]  He's probably frustrated, that furrowed brow.\n",

      "[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.180]  Lovely finish, but that is a real poacher's goal, isn't it?\n",
      "[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.180]  And the mistake. Saliba, the own goal.\n",

      "[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:55.180]  But Arsenal still look very dangerous in attack.\n",

      "[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.180]  And that's one of the biggest cheers of the day.\n",
      "[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:34.180]  That's just great. Defending is strong, it's mobile.\n",
      "[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:38.180]  It's aggressive, but it's not overcooking it.\n",

      "[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.180]  Matthew would say.\n",
      "[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.180]  A couple of minutes left.\n",
      "[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.180]  He'll be delighted.\n",
      "[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:20.180]  Be careful.\n",
      "[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:27.180]  Here's Tierney.\n",
      "[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:40.180]  Gabriel.\n",
      "[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.180]  Tierney to Jakka.\n",
      "[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:47.180]  Point game there. Pofana is there. Picked up by Partick.\n",
      "[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:50.180]  Tomiyasu. Erdogan wants that ball played.\n",
      "[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.180]  And he gets it now.\n",
      "[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:58.180]  It's their one final moment for Arsenal.\n",
      "[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:01.180]  Tierney. First time ball in!\n",
      "[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:05.180]  Should go up. Fugeti didn't look offside.\n",
      "[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:11.180]  Or didn't know that and kept him out in any case.\n",
      "[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:17.180]  Just another solid example of Arsenal's play and understanding.\n",
      "[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:21.180]  Odegaard pulling strings to clear offside.\n",
      "[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:26.180]  But Tierney hits the first time ball. He can't do much more unless they actually kept a really high line.\n",
      "[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:32.180]  Fabian Fetzer offside.\n",
      "[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:44.180]  Still at least a minute to play.\n",
      "[01:38:44.180 --> 01:39:00.180]  Partick.\n",
      "[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.180]  Here's Dakar.\n",
      "[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:06.180]  Looking for Iheanacho.\n",
      "[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:09.180]  Aggressive defending from Gabriel.\n",
      "[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:12.180]  And Smithrow.\n",
      "[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:26.180]  Might hold on to the ball. Bustling style of his.\n",
      "[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:32.180]  Maddison looking for Dakar. That wasn't bad at all. Ramsdale out.\n",
      "[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:35.180]  A real clash of heads there.\n",
      "[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.180]  Tierney and Dakar.\n",
      "[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:41.180]  Dakar flicked that ball. So did Tierney. Just put his head onto it.\n",
      "[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:49.180]  You could tell straight away.\n",
      "[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:52.180]  He'll hope here in Tierney.\n",
      "[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:57.180]  And indeed Dakar get back to their feet.\n",
      "[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.180]  Tierney is back to his feet but Dakar is still down.\n",
      "[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.180]  But they have enjoyed themselves today.\n",
      "[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:09.180]  A couple of nervy moments at times but going forward they've looked fantastic Arsenal at times.\n",
      "[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.180]  And four goals.\n",
      "[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:17.180]  Marking that out.\n",
      "[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:22.180]  They've come so close to Champions League football last season.\n",
      "[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:27.180]  Pressures on Arteta to get it to the top four this time round but things looking good in the early stages.\n",
      "[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:30.180]  Don't forget they lost their first three matches.\n",
      "[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:35.180]  They were at the bottom of the Premier League table a year ago.\n",
      "[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.180]  And they're near the top this time round.\n",
      "[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.180]  It is of course early stages.\n",
      "[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:58.180]  Pats and Dakar being checked off the pitch at the moment.\n",
